"Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other ""real"" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true ""chocolatey"" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.",tried couple brands gluten free sandwich cookies best bunch crunchy true texture real cookies gluten free might think filling makes bit sweet means satisfied sweet tooth sooner chocolate version glutino good true chocolatey taste something gluten free brands,Positive
"My cat loves these treats. If ever I can't find her in the house, I just pop the top and she bolts out of wherever she was hiding to come get a treat. She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally.

"First there was Frosted Mini-Wheats, in original size, then there was Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size. Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is ""Cinnamon Roll"".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium.

But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one star.",first frosted mini wheats original size frosted mini wheats bite size well reason much mouthful frosted mini wheats little bits yes half size bite size versions particular one cinnamon roll br br nothing new table exception size unnecessary personally like original flavor size best bite size edition accommodating come desperate attempt give attention brand needs sort life put back came making smaller new flavor actually sweet br br serving size approximately biscuits thats gram polyunsaturated fat grams carbohydrates g fiber g sugar g protein mg potassium generally look good guess watching carb intake might want careful br br probably fit spoon better predecessors bowl milk like kinds cause snack better without milk small ones easily snack br br grading product stars reasons dont think making smaller reason existing outside kellogs filling shelves versions something fine begin flavor cinnamon roll sweet synthetic taste plus side like mini wheats general saved one star,Positive

"Previously, I've attempted a recipe with white rice noodles and overcooked them, which made them soggy. So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.",previously attempted recipe white rice noodles overcooked made soggy determined overcook brown rice noodles tried making two dishes first miso soup brown rice noodles really broth miso green onions noodles added hot noodles softened puffed think softened water maybe rinsed first broth ended little starchy noodles pretty good br br noodles really flavor take flavor whatever dish rice noodles miso probably best idea mild miso flavor really give noodles much flavor also tried stir frying noodles much better soaked noodles hot water minute drained came clear kind crunchy stir fried garlic onion salt coconut oil also added vinegar nama shoyu flavor noodles came crunchy spicy actually pretty good br br nice thing noodles need minute warm water fried added soups dishes fairly versatile also gluten free brown rice noodles seem firm white rice noodles another reviewer posted look like noodles made singapore,Positive

"I am a lover of coffee and will try almost any coffee product once.

I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the ""will continue to buy"" test.

"I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS.

"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well.

The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release.

The peach flavor of Knudsen Spritzers is one of their best (i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango).  The soda doesn't contain any added sugar or other undesirables.  While the main juice isn't peach juice (most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices) it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor.

"Our elderly terrier always liked rawhide chews but she tended to gag on them and then they were difficult to digest.  She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.  I think they are a little pricy, so I look for special values which occasionally occur on Amazon, always much better than the price at the vet.",elderly terrier always liked rawhide chews tended gag difficult digest seldom enjoyed chewing exercise c e enzymatic oral hygiene chews perfect chewable treat byproduct brief moments breath freshening take place eating kibble brushing teeth really enjoys chews right size small dog pounds past purchased larger size cut heavy duty scissors petite chews fine unlike rawhide chews consumed rather quickly require strongest teeth much better older dogs still like chew think little pricy look special values occasionally occur amazon always much better price vet,Positive

Last time I ate ramen was when I was a 16 yrs old and even then I didn't care for them much (but in a pinch was a quick meal). I bought a whole bunch of noodles for my nephew who is in college and seeing the prices these were going for I HAD to try them myself.  I prepared it as instructed in the packaging. Only difference is I only used half of the seasonings packet. I always found seasoning packets too salty for my taste ( I also never drink the left over broth saves both calories and sodium) . I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well.

"With hundreds (if not thousands) of coffee brands and/or types, it's tough to choose one, especially online without tasting.  I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend.",hundreds thousands coffee brands types tough choose one especially online without tasting took shot community coffee whole bean french roast bought hamilton beach coffee bean grinder refuse buy pre ground coffee psychologically would negate value coffee bean grinder would provide br br aside bags coffee came package shrink wrapped meaning could see shapes coffee beans package since vacuum sealed package loose like see typical grocery store pretty sure effect quality brew something noticed br br moving bottom line coffee tastes good might strong used good ole mcdonald coffee decent like peet various sumatra blends coffee bean starbucks herein lies issue choosing coffee know strong particular coffee going solid solution would rate coffee scale weak super strong using guideline rate coffee terms strength great early morning need quick jolt caffeine good afternoon evening br br anyhow worth shot plan ordering community coffee weaker blend,Positive

"I just got my PB2 in the mail today, and I was very curious as to how it would taste. I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip.",got pb mail today curious would taste pleasantly surprised taste good peanut butter considering less fat pretty darn good weight watchers always trying find substitutions stick points tbsp pb equal weight watcher points plus point tbsp full fat peanut butter points however tbsp pb equal tbsp peanut paste keep mind would probably take tbsp pb get full tbsp paste anyways added tbsp pb jell pudding cup sugar free delicious tasted like reese cup able add protein flavor dessert entire thing points pb bit gritty consistency like protein powder bother sure would eat spoon definitely use pb j sandwiches shakes recipes peanut butter flavor read somewhere mixing greek yogurt good protein packed fruit dip,Positive

"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.",avid tea drinker turned drink realizing body really tolerate coffee enjoy rooibos occasion use chai serving people sensative caffine br br one important point rooibos technically tea come camellia sinensis fmaily therefore considered herbal common mistake label things true tea teas bigger mistake would label espresso br br thing red espresso common espresso aside may chose prepare ground dealing herbals teas surface area water contact brew bitter resulting beverage red espresso rather getting sweet clean tasting beverage get traditionally prepared rooibos get one much bitter sharp br br tried preparing tea number different ways found took lot get water grounds ratio right one exception never quite pleased resulting beverage best luck red espresso put stovetop water add chai spices mix drain strainer adding milk sweetner br br recognize people turn products like health benefits think disappointed experience drinking like coffee much better coffee substitute recommend choffy approximates taste coffee much closer br br looking give regular cup joe tea way go much better served picking yunnan gold assam black tea brewing strong adding milk sweetener desired set rooibos look full unground needles use brew much pleasant cup,Positive
"I purchased one variety of this product at a local gourmet grocery store (this review is for the Italian Herb mix.)  I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then.",purchased one variety product local gourmet grocery store review italian herb mix cook fresh herbs regularly thought would give shot overall glad br br first looking fresh taste nothing beat herbs picked recently possible however times impractical pick purchase freshly picked herbs also looking garnish blend work well taste better dried counterpart br br true herbs little stuck together first opened box stuck small escargot fork opening loosened fine problem clumping throughout life product br br italian blend nice bright flavor chlorophyll still present strong substitute fresh better using dried herbs recipe calls fresh great sauces way however recipe calls dried herbs need lot mix since fresh herbs concentrated dry br br used company products plan buying sometime future update review,Positive

"I've never had Finn Crisp (any flavor) or other crispbreads before. Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like. So spending 40+ mg of sodium per slice on this is not worth it.<br /><br />Well, I think I will go back to the cardboard taste Ryvita. At least it is sodium free, and I can buy just 1 box from a local store, not a pack through mail order. Personally, I prefer the cardboard taste to this faintly bitter taste.",never finn crisp flavor crispbreads pretty happy taste traditional crackers eat lot without toppings starting explore crispbread space reading health magazine hoping healthier snack especially something lower sodium tried ryvita remember flavor sodium free one tastes like cardboard find finn crisp local stores ended ordering amazon pack brave enough good reviews br br soon shipment arrived made everyone family try one thumbs everyone including makes wonder magazine people say crispbread go topless pretty much everyone wrote review think stuff tastes good faint bitter taste family tasteless eat certainly something say like spending mg sodium per slice worth br br well think go back cardboard taste ryvita least sodium free buy box local store pack mail order personally prefer cardboard taste faintly bitter taste,Positive

"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.

":: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia.

I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product.

"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",variety pack came us amazon vine program sample two cats living various high end dry cat foods time e g grain foods chicken tuna salmon versions fancy pantsy duck l orange stuff local pet shop partial canned foods often gone canned food route less convenient seem worth candle since seem favor dry food mice birds whatever else glean little acre woods typically start loving canned food bites rest sits bowl dries toss go back dry food grown love br br however cats smitten stuff looks like real food large chunks fish seafood thickened broth strong fishy smell canned foods looks like something could almost tempted eat self pinch ounce size makes perfect treat cats feedings dry food leave nothing behind dump dish added hot water really love broth br br sure want cats eating stuff reason want eight year old eating fast food franchises much might love food snarf flash concerned food may healthy thing animal eating planet seeing made thailand emblazoned box made immediately wonder whether stuff might include ingredients banned us could otherwise manufactured without adequate regulation methods materials chinese pet food fiasco certainly came mind br br discussions reviewers menadione used product confirms concern also left wonder source fish seafood cans farm raised thailand conditions wild fish may subject overfishing least ought feeding hungry humanity rather going cats gullets mercury contaminants food br br bottom line cats seem love stuff sure sufficient convince buy,Positive

"When agave first came on the scene I thought it sounded great.  But after a lot more research I don't think it's the wonder sweetener that many people think it is.  It is VERY high in (processed) fructose, not the same as fructose found in natural fruit.  Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.

"I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world.

When I took a fitness course in college I tried a whole bunch of different kinds... which all tasted like chalk to me. I would hold my breath and try not to gag or throw up. So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a ""shake"" and not a ""protein drink"" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with ""bearable"". It actually tastes like a nice strawberry smoothy.<br /><br />Now, I don't know exactly how good it is for you... since it tastes so good. So I can't comment on it's actual ""nutritional value"".  Oh, by the way, I drank the strawberry flavored one. So I don't know how good the other flavors are yet. One last thing to keep in mind is that it does contain Milk protein.. so if you're lactose intolerant, you may want to drink something else.  It also means you have to refrigerate it after opening.  I hope this review was helpful... bottoms up! :)",know since nutritional shake protein drink took fitness course college tried whole bunch different kinds tasted like chalk would hold breath try gag throw awful experience vowed never drink nutritional shakes amazon came along offered free sample review still reluctant decided face fear plus really need get back shape fact called shake protein drink made hopeful finally took first swig today pleasantly surprised yeah actually tastes good confused bearable actually tastes like nice strawberry smoothy br br know exactly good since tastes good comment actual nutritional value oh way drank strawberry flavored one know good flavors yet one last thing keep mind contain milk protein lactose intolerant may want drink something else also means refrigerate opening hope review helpful bottoms,Positive

"This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.",celestial seasonings best plump bag fresh tasty peppermint leaf brews clean delicious cup tea peppermint one enjoyable herbal teas naturally sweet clean taste br br peppermint herb many uses traditional herbal medicine reputed relax muscles digestive system helps relieve nausea peppermint combats flatulence promotes bile flow digestive juices mildly anesthetic effect also eases indigestion supposed relieve anxiety tension soothe headaches calm symptoms associated menstrual cycle br br celestial seasonings gets extra points packaging utilize natural recycled paperboard boxes package tea bag individually instead use system waxed paper bag inside box stays shut fold keeps bags fresh utilizes less packaging individually wrapping bag art use box beautiful quotes information put every surface,Positive

"Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.

I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies.

"Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.",update feb br product worked fine weeks last two weeks issues device steam intermittently everything done exactly way user error finally last week seems bearings think bearing center colum broke underside baby brezza dark presumably grease bearings device would steam blade would spin br today stopped steaming well send product back nothing problems since got wasted recommend extrememly frustrating last minute figure way feed kid products like need work work well children used everyday sure kind quality control company br br update couple weeks use br product work well yes lumps manually hit blend button bit longer get smooth puree child br one issue found blade bit difficult take pull quite hard time hard enought though going break plastic wife felt way rating stars change however stable good product use daily br br overall product works however one major problem first time tried use product would steam motor would turn blade spin called baby brezza turns manufacturing issue belt slipped cog blade knew issue immediately told remove screws bottom remove cover slip belt onto cog easy took minutes however fact get product would work right box huge dissapointment wife really frustrated br plus side lady baby brezza know issue able get going right away first time success customer service company,Positive

"I developed a real craving for some caviar a few weeks ago, after not having had any for a couple of years. I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her ""fair share."" I would buy this product from this vendor again, but I also plan to compare it with what others have to offer. I would be curious to hear what others have to say about where to get low cost high quality black caviar.

"My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy.

"[...] I took it out of the box rinsed the package kneaded as directed and ate it straight out of the package.

Almond butter is a much healthier than Peanut Butter especially this brand and another brand I ate which only contain a few ingredients.  FYI for those who like Peanut Butter Justin's brands are just as healthy as their Almond Butters.  I wanted to try the squeeze packs because the other brand I have eaten in the past though good, it's such a pain to have to stir this huge jar of it every time and I like to keep an eye on my calories so having to measure out a serving from a jar each time gets messy plus it's so bland I always add a little honey to it.  This was was perfect not bland like plain Almond Butter, but not too sweet or salty just enough of everything.  Besides the convenience of not having to stir and measure from a jar I like knowing exactly how much I am getting plus these can be thrown in my purse when I go out for a quick healthy snack when I am out.

I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.

"Once upon a time, I used cheap rice for dishes.  Over time, I have discovered that there are preferable products.  This Jasmati long grain American jasmine rice exemplifies. It is one of a series of rices produced  by Rice Select.<br /><br />It has a nice texture and a nice taste once you prepare it.  When I make my recipe for fried rice from my copy of ""Joy of Cooking,"" this is my most often used selection of rice.  The end result is tasty!  As I pour my stir fry over the fried rice, a delicious meal (well, normally) results. But a good rice base is necessary for a successful stir fry.  That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.  Yummy!<br /><br />All in all, then, this is a useful product for those who enjoy using rice in their cooking adventures!",upon time used cheap rice dishes time discovered preferable products jasmati long grain american jasmine rice exemplifies one series rices produced rice select br br nice texture nice taste prepare make recipe fried rice copy joy cooking often used selection rice end result tasty pour stir fry fried rice delicious meal well normally results good rice base necessary successful stir fry combination vegetables sauce sort meat normally chicken fried rice trick br br also use rice use slow cooker useful sort base absorb excess liquid slow cooking process rice job well one rices depend doling crock pot dish serving dish family yummy br br useful product enjoy using rice cooking adventures,Positive

"I don't like starchy, salty, and thick soups (too much starch actually makes me hungry). This particular variety (roasted chicken and vegetable) fits the bill. It is sparse on the noodle, with only 4 g of sugar per can (I have never eaten half a can of soup, so, all values are for the entire can).

The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.<br /><br />The only downside is the price.

"I like to brew myself a single cup of coffee every once in a while. I have the Melitta filters and a plastic cone holder. I place both on top of a coffee cup and pour in the hot water. This method works well once. If you plan to have a second cup of coffee, add a touch more coffee grounds, and run through another round of water, it will not work well. The flow is blocked and slow. Even if you move around the grounds with a spoon, the drip is too slow to warrant a second use.<br /><br />So these are good once.

"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.",called upon panel two expert feline food testers assist review first apollo quite enthusiastic food related assignments usually concerned quantity second lj discerning food occasionally refusing participate br br opened first selection chicken pot pie noticed quantity liquid around solid portion meal concerned perhaps spoiled detected bad odor offered panel incidentally becoming quite impatient apollo immediately began consume portion pausing dish empty lj took usual cautious sniff food began eagerly lap liquid pausing take bite solids time time stop eating entire portion consumed br br next testing session offered chinese chicken selection one looked much like canned cat food pronounced odor testers arrived stations without summoned testers enthusiastic assignments stop entire portion consumed fact testers disturbed two members canine food testing team expressed great displeasure br br preparing food samples member human food testing panel remarked feline samples particularly chinese chicken looked better much food eating college br br obviously feline panel quite taken product chief accountant issues however since product costs four times much per ounce usual offering note usual offering kept six cats quite healthy thirty years price factor mind divided single serving oz two testers supplemented dry food br br due enthusiastic endorsements feline food testers based prior experience aging felines diminished appetites purchase product future supplement usual feline menu offerings much human menu supplemented holiday meals upscale restaurant outings,Positive

"Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency.

"First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!",first buy local supermarket little cheaper even tax wanted see less amazon review br br get added salt low salt diet doctors say americans take much great tasting crazy expensive website offers two tips first natural need refrigerated however keep oil separating important turn jar upside get home hour oil absorb back butter makes easy mix first time initial mix refrigerate mixing needed br br normally get two jars time flipping upside day jars require almost mixing oil totally absorb back butter br br website says take spoon full oil makes mixing easier flipping trick find unnecessary br br anyway find cheaper amazon still glad got tell much love stuff,Positive

"I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that.",read lot positive reviews cytomax better version gatorade decided try br br boy boy boy good use workout keep stamina feel difference days use could sustain long wanted way insanity workout insanely difficult cytomax definitely keep workout better without find panting breath br br good thing cytomax highly refined pour powder bottle see white powders air see fizzing water immediately refined means mixes quickly thing annoys even though mixes well general sometimes get clumping stuck bottom bottle bad thing cytomax br br taste brilliant tried grape citrus pomegranate grape tastiest one eventually using cytomax want use product dosage cytomax also decreases become stronger could sustain longer without additional aid br br give try regret electrolytes help get cramping high intensity cardio movements usually wear quickly without replenishing sodium muscle get really tired tense cytomax helps,Positive
"I haven't had soda or carbonation in years. I got this for my parents who, to avoid sugar, drink nothing but aspartame filled fresca black cherry and peach. Figuring that is so much worse, I was so excited to find Zevia and currently am awaiting my parents to try the flavors. I myself grabbed a Dr. Zevia because I loved Dr. Pepper back when I used to drink soda. Now it has been years, so I cracked it open and noted a considerable spice and cherry smell. I took a sip and felt a punch to the throat like I downed some great tasting apple cider vinegar. That's not a problem with this product, it's just what happens when you haven't had carbonated drinks in years.

"My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.

So far I have only tried the apple juice, but based on this one, I am definitely planning to sample the others. I served it at a party and it proved to be a great alternative to beer or wine for those who didn't want to drink alcohol. My only complaint is that the can is kind of narrow and awkward -- I wish it came in bottles instead. I think the idea is to make it look more like an energy drink (it is fortified with some vitamins, but this is NOT an energy drink), but I find the bottles that other specialty sodas, like GuS or Jones, use to be easier to handle.",two complaints sodas fizzy sweet sparkling apple juice neither got natural delicious taste right amount bubbles far tried apple juice based one definitely planning sample others served party proved great alternative beer wine want drink alcohol complaint kind narrow awkward wish came bottles instead think idea make look like energy drink fortified vitamins energy drink find bottles specialty sodas like gus jones use easier handle,Positive
"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?",adopted penelope mo old min pin hound mix couple weeks ago decided switch purina pro plan w shredded chicken premium food reading many conflicting reviews site elsewhere decided try canidae sister feeds canidae great results local pet store cheapest premium foods narrow margin br br mixed little canidae penny kibble guess pieces total breakfast dinner watched closely within day noticed changes first lost little focus training seeming bit confused usual biggie also sneezed times never sneezed importantly though noticed started nibble chew feet continued sporadically another day half constant serious seem agitated bite feet point redness bleeding still clear caused change diet nothing else routine changed pieces canidae per day read reviews canidae new formula known might happen made decision switch right away br br lot research decided try solid gold hund n flocken puppies mixed solid gold proportions canidae nibbling stopped immediately sneezing either focus seems improved well though completely credit food puppies days still clear serious allergy problems resolved br br done research dog foods already know finding right food requires go beyond ingredient list foods work dogs however good look paper indeed convinced many hours reading reviews food works dogs said clear many many people problems new canidae formula premium super premium brands knows canidae claims new formula changes could account allergies cares feel free try canidae dog watch closely better yet wish start different brand nothing special canidae ingredients list risk,Positive

"This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating.

"*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",br white rose velvet garden white tea exciting unusual premium numi tea white tea rare types teas less processed well plucked dried oxidized people find white tea subtler enjoyable type tea experience know white rose velvet garden white tea certified organic fair trade kosher br br made hand wrapped white tea leaves rosebuds rosebuds imagine two ingredients delicate delicious different anything else ever tried amazon page erroneously lists ingredients absolutely tea made white tea roses br br tea like numi teas packaged post consumer waste tea bags made biodegradable filter paper numi believe practice adding oils flavorings bolster flavors love tell difference many reasons numi one favorite tea manufacturers br br box numi writes roses symbol love beauty since dawn romance numi enchanting velvet garden tm releases provocative sweet rosy taste blushes soft pink every sip liaison organic rose petals delicate spring white tea imparts silken smoothness white tea tender bud tea plant making exquisitely subtle supremely healthy high antioxidants vitamin c uplifting fair trade certified white tea blend beginning long lasting love affair agree truly amazing tea br br like numi teas get sorry new numi love white tea curious try description think could find better source numi looking romantic tea white rose velvet garden white tea fits bill perfectly br br highly recommended br,Positive

The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.

Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.

Even worse, the liver had dark, grey spots that would turn my stomach just looking at them. Perhaps good cod liver has become a thing of the past, like many other delicacies. I would prefer if they just raised the price to whatever it needs to be to provide the quality that we deserve when we spend our hard earned money, or, if that's not possible, just let the fish live and make soyburgers or something.",favourite brand cod liver hard find toronto buy dozen time find however last purchase every one cans opened lightly packed one third liver rest oil even worse liver dark grey spots would turn stomach looking perhaps good cod liver become thing past like many delicacies would prefer raised price whatever needs provide quality deserve spend hard earned money possible let fish live make soyburgers something,Positive
"My 9 yr old Jackie has always been a fussy eater. Even finding treats she likes has been a challange. Once she hit 5 yrs she started getting plaque buildup that required annual cleaning. Last year we started giving her CET AquaDent in her water and this Jan we added C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to boost in the cleaning. Not only is it helping to keep her teeth cleaner, breath fresher, but she absolutely LOVES them. When ""treat time"" is approaching she begins ""woofing"" to remind us of the time. When I open the bag she is fixated on me until I give it to her. She gets so excited over something that seems to be good for her.

"My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more.

"I don't generally crave candy or sweets that often, but if I have a weakness, it's sour lemon-flavored candy.  Here's the problem: I can never find one that satisfies me.<br /><br />Until now!  I have bought all sorts of different brands and types of sour lemon candies, in a bit of a ""search for the Holy Grail"" quest, and I believe I've found it.  These are absolutely great from start to finish.  They are sour all the way through, not like other candies that are coated with sour sugar, which gives you about 15 seconds of sour, and then are super-sweet the rest of the way.<br /><br />Everything about these is great, they're not too big and not too small.  And there's a bonus waiting for you in the middle:  A section of extra-sour lemony goodness that'll make ya pucker a little.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't annoying sour, like Warheads (which again, only are sour on the outside), but they are certainly have more kick than, say, your average lemon drop by Brach's or similar products.<br /><br />I recently got my order of 2 lbs. of these, which will last me a while, but I will certainly be re-ordering these again when I run out.

"I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.

"I recently ordered this product and can say that I am extremely pleased with the results. The taste is good, albeit strong; I recommend taking it with a generous portion of water. The creatine in it makes it easy to get your daily requirement and perhaps the most note-able ingredient in this is the endo-thermogens. I noticed that the rate at which I sweated had increased significantly and I was very hungry after my workout (I'm pretty sure that that is a good thing). As for the energy, I am sure that a caffeine product would give me more energy, but I would rather not become dependent upon stimulants such as that. With that in mind, I can say that I have more energy when working out to do more reps. I have seen significant strength gains in the three weeks I have spent using this product; my squat has gone up more than 50 pounds, deadlift about 20, bench about 10, and Preacher Curls an amazing 20 pounds!! Finally, I have noticed better pumps since starting it. Overall, I can say that I would definitely buy this product another time, and for the price you get quite a good amount of it.

"Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the ""bad stuff"" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality.

(For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings.

You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!",perusing cereal aisle lot choices days clearly good ok going hour sugar buzz neither really huge favor perhaps one thought raisin bran good found sugar fruit loops br br enter quaker oatmeal squares case infused hint cinnamon first two thoughts must good quaker oats mmm cinnamon br br bottom line sweeten bit cereal good crunchy first overwhelming cinnamon flavor ways bit bland flavor acceptable crunch wear quickly though let soak couple minutes br br pitch square cinnamon baked well honestly matter baked sprinkled think could use bit flavor mostly opinion others may find right cereal consists grams whole grains per serving part good going consume cereal consume made whole grains also packs decent amount soluble fiber g protein g high dry cereal calories cup serving quaker oatmeal squares cereal cinnamon caloric breakdown fat carbs protein cereal g sugar per serving br br cereal eater looking something healthier cap n crunch probably better selection said caution anyone starting day ton carbohydrates especially derived sugary sources anything aware serving practice moderation measured many folks would potentially consume servings case cups single bowl would equate quick calories breakfast,Positive

"Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( ½ teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your ½ teaspoon squeeze (or carry a ½ teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others.

"Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with ¾ tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.",lipton yellow label ctc crush tear curl processed black indian tea lipton makes uk india markets folks take tea milk sugar ctc tea looks little like coarse coffee grounds brews quickly dark robust liquor stand milk sugar tea drinkers say process gains heartiness cost subtlety perfume br ctc makes stronger brew leaf tea ewww tea bags start tsp yellow label per cup steep three minutes adjust taste next time find second extraction six minute steep quite drinkable matter taste br settled yellow label daily cuppa trying several kinds leaf tea years also tried tetley another ctc blend found one dimensional heavy single estate leaf teas still delight inner tea snob cost makes occasional treats daily tipples br scale value money yellow label clear winner know tea price range tastes good yes find teas offer complexity subtlety bouquet lot money br looking daily cuppa delivers real tea satisfaction pennies cup hard go wrong yellow label start one lb box two two lb boxes even better value year worth tea house,Positive

"This is a very tasty cereal, but I find it a bit too sweet for my liking.

In terms of sugar content Crunchy Nut is comparable to Honey Nut Cheerios (about 10 g each) so if you like that amount of sugar in your cereal then the choice between these two will come down to taste. The little pieces of nuts that are embedded in each O are hardly noticeable, both visually and in terms of the overall taste. It turns out that these are technically speaking not really nuts, but rather peanuts. They mostly have an effect in terms of the overall flavor - the combination of corn/oats and peanut pieces is probably responsible for the peanut-buttery taste. The Os are indeed very crunchy, and they are among the crunchiest cereals that I have ever tried. They don't lose this crunchiness easily even after a minute or two of soaking in milk. Crunchy Nut Os also make a very tasty and convenient snack. I have also tried them with blueberries and the fruity flavor comes as a nice contrast to all the sugariness of this cereal.

I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar.

"I was buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE"">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to.

I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup,lb pitbull mastiff mix often loves rope bone squeaker toy thought would great challenge thinking toys bit weary toy dog might chew plastic treat covers found rather tough food incentive greater chew incentive overall took minutes advice instructions pup way collecting treats new puzzle takes seconds pull right cap start chowing goodies another thing would like note clean pretty easy washed tray cups hot water soap let dry next counter br br social writeup,Positive

"I have to LOL a bit at the ""How do you rate this item?"" question for this review.  How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that.",lol bit rate item question review would rate item like uh sure feel really emotional item absolutely love picture sitting chewing one treat biscuits br br suppose joke much since stories people eating dog food years really human animal human equation opinion really one matters product matters doggie thinks seems react given one treats things remain tough though family dog behaves like many dogs edible heck lot things like stuffed toys die quick deaths gone quickly question whether ever even tasted whatever gave br br said dry biscuits tend slow little least compared treats might give example href http www amazon com gp product b ouoyh cardinal laboratories pet botanics training rewards treats beef ounces dry got slow bit crunch treats case smaller dog pomeranian really crunch things even break biscuits apart come breakable bars two smaller portions bar larger dog much work least doubt would find bit later intend take treats lady friend house much bigger family dog give try br br realistically newman brand one enjoy supporting good reputation products always good dog treats seem yet another good example,Positive

We brewed a couple cups at the office (in a cubicle) and the rich aroma carried through the office air vents, attracting droopy-eyed co-workers in search of chocolate.<br /><br />Delicate for a flavored coffee, this blend made a delicious afternoon treat.

"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***",br br tazo earl grey black tea perfumy used drinking super premium tea real bergamot added essence tea tasted like regular black tea strong bergamot like flavor definitely care although love earl grey teas general paper tea packet tazo writes aromatic version earl traditional black tea scented essence bergamot therein lies problem little perfumy scented web site tazo describes flavor profile passion floral lavender fragrant spicy lemon tazo describes aroma citrus lavender light smoke may like apparently reviewers far br br also careful letting tea brew long accidently even minutes long results bitter bitter tea reminiscent orange pekoe strong perfume added letdown even properly brewed though tea cannot opinion warrant three stars br br ingredients earl grey black teas bergamot essence note earl grey contain caffeine br br tazo interesting company makes super premium teas socially responsible based portland motto reincarnation tea tazo owned starbucks web site fun quirky zen type focus definitely worth checking unclear though web site many ingredients organic kosher use natural flavors teas wording seems little vague super premium tea br br,Positive

"I'm not a great cook, so we wind up eating a lot of burgers and fries in our house. Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.<br /><br />I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly ""plastic"" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:<br /><br />The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as ""plastic""-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion. I actually like it better thinned with a little Duke's mayonnaise, but only because that cuts down even more on the slight gumminess.<br /><br />I expect we'll buy more.",great cook wind eating lot burgers fries house instead picking fast food prepare frozen burger patties fries oven tried taco bell jalapeno sauce tonight burgers dip fries instead usual ketchup mustard really woke taste made normally boring meal little bit special br br know particular thickening agents responsible mouth feel dressing tend dislike whatever kraft uses salad dressings sauces tend feel almost slimey gummy lack better word tongue decidedly plastic e overly processed fake food taste forget low fat versions anything rather without taste prefer taste mouth feel ken salad dressings especially carb creamy caesar familiar products maybe following make sense br br taco bell jalapeno sauce lot closer mouth feel ken kraft still something bit gummy feel nearly plastic tasting though quite tasty hamburgers think scorching hot got bit kick pairs well slice raw onion actually like better thinned little duke mayonnaise cuts even slight gumminess br br expect buy,Positive
"If you find some of the Kitchens of India recipes a little bland, this one is the opposite: very strong flavors deliciously blend to create a wonderful meal.  This one takes a little longer to make due to the need to marinate the meet for 20 minutes, and also because the recipe calls for 1/3 cup lemon curd (I had to Google this but found it easy to make from a few common ingredients). So while not exactly a ""heat and serve"" recipe, it is still easy and very delicious if you like Indian spices.  My wife and I both loved the strong flavors in the dish, but my wife found it a little bit on the spicy-hot side, while for me ""nothing is too hot"", and this dish was just moderately spicy.  I was tempted to substitute yogurt for the lemon curd, but was really glad I made the lemon curd like the recipe said, because I could taste the hint of lemon in the final product, and it was a really nice touch.

"When you buy Natural Balance (Dick Van Patten's Brand from ""Eight is Enough"" -- who knew) you will discover that you are paying more than your regular Friskies, 9-Lives or regular store available brands.  In fact, sometimes this brand is hard to find ... but it's worth every penny.<br /><br />Our cats enjoy a mixture of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008VKBEQ"">Wellness Healthy Weight Formula Dry Cat Food</a> and Natural Balance wet food.  I use the Indoor formula because they are indoor cats.  Our cats love this formula and chow it down like happy campers.  Their fur is soft as can be, their eyes are bright and they are in great health.<br /><br />You need to understand that in the world of cat food like so many other things, you really get what you pay for.  You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of ""corn meal"" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.<br /><br />Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is ""corn meal"" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.<br /><br />With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat ""poop"" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.

"****<br /><br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****",br br tazo wild sweet orange herbal infusion nice orange herbal tea contains lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root licorice root sweet fruity subtle wonderful tea enjoy orangey teas br br tazo interesting company makes super premium teas socially responsible based portland motto reincarnation tea tazo owned starbucks web site fun quirky zen type focus definitely worth checking unclear though web site many ingredients organic kosher use natural flavors teas wording seems little vague super premium tea br br paper tea packet tazo writes lively blend sweet citrus herbs orange essences sweet yet tart cup liquid sunshine radiating multi layered orange flavors exotic hints spice distinctive floral finish wild indeed web site tazo describes flavor profile wild sweet orange tart sweet smooth licorice tazo describes aroma oranges roses lime pretty accurate although words give hope taste tea never quite approaches br br would rate tea tazo general good better premium teas like stash celestial seasonings good numi soooooo spoiled numi teas tazo wild sweet orange gets four stars br br,Positive

"Probably the best thing about MIO is its portability and sharability. The problem is that the flavor  may not be outstanding enough for anyone to want to share.<br /><br />I don't particularly care for the phony label ""Water Enhancer"". Adding an artificial color, artificial sweetener, and an unnatural taste that only approximates the flavor created in nature does not seem like an enhancement to me.<br /><br />The MIO is easy to use - flip open the cap, squeeze some MIO into the water for an explosion of color, taste, squeeze again, taste, squeeze again if necessary, continue squeezing and tasting until satisfied, and then clip the lid shut.<br /><br />The inexact nature of the squeeze is a sticking point for me because it's almost impossible to duplicate the exact amount squeezed each time. One could measure half a teaspoon of liquid first but that defeats the design of the product.<br /><br /> I've only tried the Mango/Peach. It has great color but only average taste that tastes slightly artificial. There is a chalky aftertaste after each swallow, but not an obtrusive one.  I much prefer Crystal Light for taste though I also find it tedious to mix just the right amount of product into the water with the CL.<br /><br />Anyone so inclined might find it easy to shoplift such a small handful of a container, but the taste of the product might preclude such shenanigans.",probably best thing mio portability sharability problem flavor may outstanding enough anyone want share br br particularly care phony label water enhancer adding artificial color artificial sweetener unnatural taste approximates flavor created nature seem like enhancement br br mio easy use flip open cap squeeze mio water explosion color taste squeeze taste squeeze necessary continue squeezing tasting satisfied clip lid shut br br inexact nature squeeze sticking point almost impossible duplicate exact amount squeezed time one could measure half teaspoon liquid first defeats design product br br tried mango peach great color average taste tastes slightly artificial chalky aftertaste swallow obtrusive one much prefer crystal light taste though also find tedious mix right amount product water cl br br anyone inclined might find easy shoplift small handful container taste product might preclude shenanigans,Positive

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",five cats one elderly cat years four year range oldest cat diagnosed couple months ago beginning stages chronic kidney disease numbers warrant prescription food yet needed start paying attention things like protein phosphorus levels food five cats nibblers eating four five nuggets time decided switch acceptable food oldest picked active longevity specifically mentioned kidney support calories appropriate less active older cats br br since made switch weeks ago cats gained weight fine little old guy bit underweight good rest male went slightly chunky lbs obese lbs almost three pounds weeks females gained pounds noticed making lot visits food bowl like seem get full also saw lessening coat quality lots shedding even though brushed regularly including furminator one developed bad dandruff stools developed really bad odor although say nobody developed diarrhea grateful worrisome lab results old guy came back kidney values concern worsened br br disgusted science diet actively fooling public nutritional claims bags one sites researched chronic renal failure charts detailing nutritional breakdown various foods available compare various science diet formulae different health claims nutritional values components listed within tenth point two basically nutritional analysis appears base formula maybe slight difference vitamin additive brands innova royal canin appears actual difference different formulae br br deal weight gain well problems noted switching foods time trying royal canin indoor mature wish us luck,Positive
"This has quickly become a staple in our home! It has a pleasant nutty taste that is nice plain or seasoned and works well with a lot of other foods. It doesn't need to be rinsed and cooks up easily in the rice cooker.<br /><br />I love that I can get it started with one hand in less than a minute with a baby on my hip! One time when I made it, I measured out the whole package with my rice cooker cup (3.5 rice cooker cups) and added twice as much water (7 rice cooker cups). I took note of the water level in the rice cooker bowl (right at my ""Sweet 6"" line). So now I can just dump the pouch in the bowl, fill with water up to the Sweet 6 line, set it to the brown rice setting, and start. That's it! My rice cooker brown rice setting takes 1 hr 45 minutes. I start it early in the day and the rice cooker keeps it warm until I'm ready for it. It always comes out light and fluffy. I have not tried it with the quick rice setting or on the stove-top, so I'm honestly not sure if there is any difference in taste or texture between the methods.<br /><br />I make an entire package once or twice a week. My family of 5 eats about 1/3 of it the first night and we finish it as leftovers over the next few days. One of my favorite ways to serve it is as quinoa salad, which I make with cold (leftover) quinoa, tomato, cucumber, maybe some onions, avocado and/or bell peppers, feta and some red wine vinaigrette. The texture of the quinoa goes well with the salad, and it soaks up the vinaigrette and takes on the taste. It is really a delight.<br /><br />The price with Subscribe & Save is great, especially considering that it is organic and fair trade, and doesn't need to be rinsed.",quickly become staple home pleasant nutty taste nice plain seasoned works well lot foods need rinsed cooks easily rice cooker br br love get started one hand less minute baby hip one time made measured whole package rice cooker cup rice cooker cups added twice much water rice cooker cups took note water level rice cooker bowl right sweet line dump pouch bowl fill water sweet line set brown rice setting start rice cooker brown rice setting takes hr minutes start early day rice cooker keeps warm ready always comes light fluffy tried quick rice setting stove top honestly sure difference taste texture methods br br make entire package twice week family eats first night finish leftovers next days one favorite ways serve quinoa salad make cold leftover quinoa tomato cucumber maybe onions avocado bell peppers feta red wine vinaigrette texture quinoa goes well salad soaks vinaigrette takes taste really delight br br price subscribe save great especially considering organic fair trade need rinsed,Positive

"OK, so it isn't exactly as good as grilled cheese, but melting a slice of cheese on one of these crispy discs in the microwave is close enough for me, plus no need for fattening butter. The ""thins"" are about a quarter-inch thick (maybe a little less), not too thick and not too thin.  They offer a multitude of options for quick GF meals, perfect for someone like me who typically eats several 1-course small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large multi-course ones.  The taste is very mild, relying on whatever you put on them to add 95% of the flavor.  By the way, they are called Corn Thins, but technically they are made out of ""popped corn""; so they are a little puffy, sort of like rice cakes but thinner and crispier.<br />My batch just arrived with an expiration date of October 2010, which is a tight time frame but because these are so versatile, I think I can manage finishing them by then.<br /><br />UPDATE (Feb. 2010) The last two unfinished packages were stale by the end of August.

"The ONLY reason I give ZATARAIN'S NEW ORLEANS STYLE JAMBALAYA MIX, 8-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 12), four stars instead of 5 is because one must buy 12 boxes together, here on Amazon.  It's scrumptious rice, but I must agree with another reviewer who said his family got tired of it after ""only"" 3 boxes, and the rest is now sitting on the shelf. Too much of anything -- even something as delicious as this rice -- does get tiring after a while.  Of oourse there are all kinds of customers who buy from Amazon -- some people are lucky enough to have friends, family or neighbours to share the large quantities, and prices, that Amazon puts into it's quantity packages.<br />But others, like myself, have only two -- or only one-- person for whom to buy food.

"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the aftertaste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available - 10 years? - because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price?

I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.

I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product.

"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.

"When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie",female cat came w pancreatitis years ago tune started researching diet include vet wanted canned food low carbs gracie care prescription brand buying vet also noticed corn ingredient asked considering corn sugary veggie also wanted gracie lose lbs told main idea eat canned food less carbohydrates dry state means take food dry get true percentages carbs etc br research web pancreatitus cats found grain cat food bring aggravate condition read many articles explained cats need grain diet pet food manufacturers put sounds good us pet owners read food contains brown rice etc good us know always good br br looked many companies made grain free food impressed w wellness many varieties grain free called get percentage carbs dry matter basis prepared quick answer w transfer times br food inexpensive cat really likes bout w pancreatitis occured years ago wellness ever since excellent health yrs old br br highly endorse product get another cat someday feed grain free food kittenhood br btw also make grain free dry food tried br br good luck br allie,Positive

It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog ""Swiderski,"" and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.

"I love popcorn but don't have it very often, so when I do I want great popcorn. As odd as it may sound, I have worked at it over the years to get it ""right."" I'm satisfied with my process and usually use Orville's, but recently found that I love the popcorn at Sundance Theaters. Sometimes I stop in their lobby just to pick up a bag of popcorn to take home for supper. I learned the trick of adding a touch of coconut oil to the popping oil and now I'm on a hunt for the best popping corn. I bought this even though to me the product and shipping cost was steep. I thought that if we bonded---me and the popping corn---it would be worth it. Well, it arrived poorly packed but intact. No matter, I made a batch of popcorn that night and settled in to watch ""Leverage."" The popcorn was tasteless. Made the same way as always, it was completely tasteless. I actually threw it out, which is so unlike me. I threw out the batch and I threw out the entire bag of popping corn. I've been an Amazon.com user since its inception and I think this is only my second poor review. If the popcorn and shipping cost wasn't so pricey it would be a small matter. I just don't want someone else to overextend themselves like I did in a purchase and have such a bad experience. I may be some kind of popcorn elitist, so let me just say that if you have gourmet tastes when it comes to popcorn and a slender pocketbook, don't take a chance on this brand unless you can try a smaller amount, closer to home.",love popcorn often want great popcorn odd may sound worked years get right satisfied process usually use orville recently found love popcorn sundance theaters sometimes stop lobby pick bag popcorn take home supper learned trick adding touch coconut oil popping oil hunt best popping corn bought even though product shipping cost steep thought bonded popping corn would worth well arrived poorly packed intact matter made batch popcorn night settled watch leverage popcorn tasteless made way always completely tasteless actually threw unlike threw batch threw entire bag popping corn amazon com user since inception think second poor review popcorn shipping cost pricey would small matter want someone else overextend like purchase bad experience may kind popcorn elitist let say gourmet tastes comes popcorn slender pocketbook take chance brand unless try smaller amount closer home,Positive

And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas.

All this results in a granola/cereal that you can feel good about eating because there isn't anything weird in it; it's all natural ingredients and you can see what it is you're eating.

"I consider the GoLean ""chewy"" bars to be superior to any other nutritional bar out there, and I think this is the best flavor.

"I've tried other brands of VCO, but I keep coming back to Nutiva. It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.",tried brands vco keep coming back nutiva well blended smooth flavor best tried love use kinds cooking especially good cooking bitter greens like turnips collards coconut taste helps cut bitterness giving marvelous flavor greens br br discovered fantastic way make healthy popcorn using vco tried stovetop method past using olive oil always burned pot put great heaping tablespoon vco quart fagor canning pot melt induction burner dump popcorn kernels cover bottom single layer put glass lid fits pot follow popping process jiggling pot little keep unpopped kernels falling bottom kernels pop listen popping slow like microwave popcorn turn induction burner let pot sit minute last kernels pop makes wonderfully vco coated popcorn enjoyed without salt necessary add little fine popcorn salt toss,Positive

"I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better ""communicate"" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula. We'll continue with our Gerber Good Start, and as much breast milk as possible.",say really wanted formula work son husband big whole foods organic people wanted son well milk supply never grew sufficient clearly imperfect breast milk perfect organic want baby consuming chemicals br br everything worked fine weeks son would spit extent almost every feeding attributed issues formula started better communicate us realized would cry nonstop feedings seem normal would continue suck would sob eating heartbreaking burped incessantly thinking may gas sleep fussy nothing would calm dirty diaper day sometimes even less would often harder would expected br br extensive research started little one gerber good start protect contains whey protein casein known create curds baby tummy anyone tummy really also probiotics like breast milk gave first bottle new stuff saw bottle started pout started drinking could almost see relief face fuss feedings instantly happier calmer smiling beautiful boy back almost days naps hour less got back regular hour naps better sleeping night br br want son wholesome ingredients possible believe sometimes way ingredients mixed negative think may case formula continue gerber good start much breast milk possible,Positive

"Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell.

"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",really good choice nutritionally sound lower calorie food cat admittedly picky immediately devoured real message need find many kcal day cat needs weight loss research calories cat food accurately measure feeding appear industry standards labeled weight management light etc differences dramatic br br young energetic cat starting piling weight kitten maybe stuffs rescue know whether might starvation early weeks marked life put adult food kitten year advice veterinarian went gain weight almost lb even giving recommended daily amount food measured divided daily feedings br br decided switch purina pro plan regular adult formula weight management formula still kitty gaining finally research many kcal day getting many kcal giving mind recommended measured amount shocked packaging recommends g day food weight loss cat goal weight lbs calories measured nutrition information research showed recommended amount calories day weight loss goal weight lb means minimum amount recommended purina label calories day getting maximum recommended amount getting weight loss br br publication calorie counts cup wide variety cat food br range calories staggering anyone overweight cat cat favor research many calories day getting many calories recommended amount feeding actually br br finding much pro plan weight management per day offer thought problems started giving daily amount right calories weight loss start losing slow safe rate lb week constantly frantically hungry looked nutritionally sound food could give volume fill still exceeding calories would need weight loss help nutritional ratings calorie chart selected science diet light approximately calories per cup compared purina pro plan give g day think higher fiber content food help feel full cost previous food difference going break bank estimate cost per month,Positive

If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",br stash lemon ginger caffeine free herbal tea basic lemon ginger tea tasting strongly ginger full flavorings oddly even contains soy one better commercial highly processed non organic teas much prefer organic teas made without artificial flavorings certainly without soy picky herb teas looking something strongly flavored introduction world teasans decaffeinated beverages would fine like tea subtle true pure tastes discern complex differences natural commercial teas definitely would recommend numi tea yogi tea traditional medicinals even stash organic line teas comes wonderful lemon ginger organic tea br br stash lemon ginger tea contains ginger root lemongrass lemon flavor safflower hibiscus citric acid soy br br unfortunately nothing special br,Positive

"I'm always on the lookout for a good salsa, and prefer salsas that deliver both robust flavor and heat. Sadly, Herdez fails on both accounts.<br /><br />My first impression when pour some salsa into a bowl was how much water there was. I had shaken the bottle prior to opening, and expected a better mix. The flavor was weak. For such a simple recipe I expected to taste tomatoes and onions, but there was really nothing there. The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.<br /><br />I'll not be buying another bottle.

"I like flavored coffee's but not as much as a good nice light to medium roast blend of just regular ol' Java. I find flavored coffee's to just be a bit too much.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup.

"I am definitely a chocolate lover, and fond of granola as a cereal so thought I'd try a bag of this, even though it isn't necessarily meant as a cereal.

"This dry kibble was the third try in our quest to find a balanced kibble for our Bernese Moutnain Dog. There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking! Our BMD had ZERO gastric upset during transition and became energetic again. Nature's Variety has produced nearly half the stools, which are small compact and virtually odorless. He has NO gas and his coat is shiny and feels conditioned. People are noticing the change and we couldnt be happier.

"When I first started using Clear products for my hair, I noticed a distinct difference in the health of my hair. After about two months of usage, other people have started noticing and commenting as well that my hair seems healthier. That is important to keep in mind as I review this specific product.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Any little thing will weigh it down. In fact, that's the one complaint I had about the first Clear product I reviewed (Strong Lengths) - I lost what little volume I had. I didn't want to lose the benefits of the sleek, shiny healthiness I found with Strong Lengths from Clear, so I tried the Strong Lengths shampoo and the Volumizing Root Boost conditioner together before switching to the volumizing shampoo. To be honest, I didn't seem much of a difference with that combination.<br /><br />Next, I switched to using both the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I did see a difference in the volume of my hair, but it also became more fly-away and less sleek. That has made it a little harder to manage, especially with my new short cut. (I made the switch two weeks after I got my hair cut.)<br /><br />I really don't like to use other volumizing solutions other than a little hair spray. But, I think I would prefer those over the results I get from this volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm glad to have the set. I'm glad to have tried it. And, if I still had long hair I might even like it. But, with my current hair cut, I doubt I'll go out and buy this product.

"Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review.

"Pros:<br />-  Packaging keeps portions noticeably fresher than cans.<br />-  Portions are (for my cats) ideal servings.  They are not large cats, but not kittens either.  Each pack seems to be just the right amount.  I no longer have opened, half full, cans of food sitting around that sometimes go to waste.<br />-  Dispensing into the bowl is a much more clean process than with cans.<br />-  Variety of flavors in each box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Despite the Pros, I had to give it 3 stars because both of my cats (and a catfood eating dog, don't ask) will only eat the pouches that contain tuna.  That means 1/2 of the pouches seem to end up going to waste. I can remedy this by purchasing differently, but felt it was important since 3/3 pets agreed at my house.<br />-  If your cat is large, the portions will most likely be too small.<br /><br />Tip: Shake the pouch by holding it at the top before opening the top.  This pushes all of the juice down to the bottom of the pouch.  There is a chance when you rip it open that you'll get catfood juice on your hands if you don't.",pros br packaging keeps portions noticeably fresher cans br portions cats ideal servings large cats kittens either pack seems right amount longer opened half full cans food sitting around sometimes go waste br dispensing bowl much clean process cans br variety flavors box br br cons br despite pros give stars cats catfood eating dog ask eat pouches contain tuna means pouches seem end going waste remedy purchasing differently felt important since pets agreed house br cat large portions likely small br br tip shake pouch holding top opening top pushes juice bottom pouch chance rip open get catfood juice hands,Positive

"I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.<br /><br />Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.<br /><br />And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.

Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4ARBE"">Sweet N' Spicy</a> flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad.

"I have a beagle with bad food allergies, I started a different limited ingredient food and she still had loose stools so I decided to give taste of the wild pacific stream a try. She has no more loose stools and its only been 2 weeks now. This is the first food I tried that helped with that. I can't say how good otherwise because its only been 2 weeks now, but so far so good and I called the company and they do guarantee that it is ethoxyquin free. It is also one of the top foods on dog food analysis. Since she is a beagle and only 25 pounds, I am pleased with the protein amount for a dog her size. The last food she was on was lower protein and some are to high for her size. I made sure this food was ethoxyquin free before I purchased it. She loves it. This is the first time in a year that her stools are formed, and not very loose. I am having her allergy tested in 2 weeks so I will know if its ok for her to stay on this food but so far eliminating grains for her has been great. I won't know the full effect until a few months as far as the itchiness and biting her feet, but so far this is helping her a lot. I will give an update once she is on it longer. I have tried quite a few other limited ingredient foods and allergy formulas and she would vomit and have a ton of itching, but this one she tolerated right away and I weaned her slowly.

"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.  It's only fair.",boy make sad see many people leaving comments shipping problems reviews rating product service received salsa star average rating strictly people understand product review unfair manufacturer product case relatively small family owned operation texas called riba foods shoppers trying find good product based review system wish amazon would offer review button opposed helpful helpful abuse click helpful counter inaccurate product rating abuse ignorance br br get rightfully accused hypocrisy review salsa fantastic salsas sold run mill grocery stores marketed hot actually hot hot salsas list type hot chilies ingredients show hot salsas tepid canned tomatoes hot salsas tasty barely break medium barrier one actually spicy milk oh dear stomach acid throat lining good ulcer hot love br br aside relatively widely available hot salsa think mrs renfro mango habanero love one suffers unfortunate problem thin watery thin chunks taste fantastic texture monumentally disappointing br br well one texture perfect thick clings chip see little flecks roasted chili skin seeds br br one thing threw salsa made bypass several times finally trying ingredients list contains carrots carrots weird br br even weirder hint salsa carrot flavour carrot texture find chunk carrot jar save life suspect might pureed thickening maybe makes salsa thicker clingy usually get traditional mexican roasted salsa like one br br taste roasted pepper flavour really feel heat tomatoes stellar salty tortilla chip provides enough burn lasts find sucking air tongue several minutes stopped indulging br br like truly spicy salsa without track specialty chilihead shoppe know deliciousness roasted peppers heck roasted anything give try imagine would regret br br oh try find love everyone favour leave review product product think five star salsa star shipping proper rating five stars four three five save shipping complaints shipper fair,Positive

"I saw these noodles at a local international food store.  I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.  You have to eat them with the knowledge that you are looking for an acceptable substitute.",saw noodles local international food store bought two packs husband trying low fat low carb diet craving noodles prepared found helpful review amazon gave great tips preparation br drain rinse colander sieve minute remove fishy smell rinse rinse well br long much longer normal fettuccine noodle might want take kitchen shears cut noodles thirds usually leave colander snip around pile noodles precise easy br dry fry frying pan minutes medium notice noodles become opaque seeing much wetness really standing water pan move noodles around probably ready br may necessary remove pan prepare rest dish add end saute pan ingredients minutes br br possible preparation try soy ginger garlic chili paste add tomato spinach mushrooms nice stir fry shred roast saute carrot onion spices maybe little bit red wine something like beef noodles br br verdict remind ramen noodles little bite perfect substitute work satisfy craving noodle feeling deprived diet allow noodles trying cut carbs think set right expectations meant exact substitute eat knowledge looking acceptable substitute,Positive

"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.

Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.

All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, ""what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?""<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, ""filed""), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has ""purifying grains"", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars.

"Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise.

"These Chocoperfection bars taste so good, you'll never believe they are good for you!  I get these at my local Jimbo's for $3.85each but am hoping they will be available from Amazon soon!  What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as ""fast food"" for the probiotic beneficial or ""friendly"" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose.",chocoperfection bars taste good never believe good get local jimbo hoping available amazon soon delicious way g grams fiber br br instead sugar chocoperfection uses erythritol fewer calories sugar fewer maltitol effect insulin levels oligofructose sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily chicory fructose br br silky smooth delicious chocolate bars actually help lose weight high fiber content high fiber content also acts appetite suppressant br br unlike maltitol sweetened chocolate chocoperfection bars never upset stomach give gas make bloat stall weight loss chocolate perfect br br top chocoperfection diabetic safe tooth freindly could ask chocolate bar br br erythritol br br like xylitol erythritol polyol sometimes called sugar alcohol although none contain sugar alcohol cavity fighting similarities br br xylitol sweet sugar calories br br erythritol hand sweet sugar almost zero calories plus better tolerated people br br less gastronomical laxative reactions way xylitolnow sells erythritol bulk main product page br br sweet sugar erythritol sometimes needs little help sweetness department case bars oligofrutose comes br br oligofructose br br oligofructose br wikipedia free encyclopedia br br oligofructose sometimes called fructooligosaccharide fos subgroup inulin specifically fructose polymers degree polymerization dp lt unlike carbohydrates digested human small intestine thus lower calorific value whilst contributing dietary fiber oligofructose soluble side due lower chain length general class inulins therefore commonly used additive yoghurt dairy products used specially combination high intensity artificial sweeteners whose sweetness profile aftertaste improves oligofructose also prebiotic stimulating growth bifidobacteria particular br br food sources br fos extracted fruits vegetables like bananas onions chicory root garlic asparagus barley wheat tomatoes jerusalem artichoke found one highest concentrations fos case chocoperfection oligofructose extracted chicory root br br health benefits br fos popular dietary supplement japan many years becoming increasingly popular western cultures prebiotic effects fos serves fast food probiotic beneficial friendly bacteria naturally populate gut increasing ability benefit overall gastrointestinal tract gi tract health especially proper digestion also touted supplement preventing yeast infections br br steggall nutrition br br oligofructose tremendous substrate bifidus bacteria stimulating activity several hundred percent called prebiotic activity referring stimulation health promoting bacteria intestinal tract short chain fatty acids produced lowering ph levels providing energy source growth maintenance large intestine cells process leads differentiation cancer cells vital step required cancer cells killed br br ideal environment healthy bacteria quite different environment preferred pathogens gram negative putrefactive bacteria consequently undesirable bacteria diminish number healthy bacteria proliferate presence oligofructose,Positive

"I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver.

"The flavor is labeled as fruit punch, and it bears a resemblance to Hi-C Fruit Punch, but not as sugary. With the recommended mixture, it tastes like watered-down Hi-C. If you add more, it tastes fruitier without becoming overly sweet. However, it doesn't taste very natural, again like Hi-C. There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream. The carbonation dulls taste buds, so the soda water needs a lot of syrup for full flavor.<br /><br />It claims to be an energy drink, but I didn't notice any boost in my energy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great. For people who dislike plain water, this makes it less boring without overwhelming you with fruit flavors or sugary sweetness. But if you need energy or something sweet, you should buy a can of soda-pop.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: It was suggested to me that it might be okay for masking the off-flavors of cheap vodka.

"Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla) is one of the only brands so far,that I have found that has an unsweetened choice in other flavors than plain - they even have a chocolate unsweetened but it's hard to find.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety.I try to stay away from sugar and dairy products is a thing of the past for me.I started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line.

"Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.

"This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.<br /><br />I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.

They are about twice as expensive as the milk-bones at Amazon, FWIW, but that is consistent with many organic foods.<br /><br />I have tested my dog a few times to see which she prefers, making her sit and putting one of each on the floor. The first time, she went straight for the Newman's. The next several times, she went straight for the Milk-Bones.

"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.",one biggest frustrations weight watchers always problem finding good chips eat baked ones undeniably different regular fried chips addition never able find baked chip came salt vinegar flavor favorite type chip meant whenever craving particular flavor eat regular fried kind br br picked oversize bag barbecue flavor pop chips whim costco heard curious like never able find area much surprise thin husband totally addicted barbecue chips loved pretty much ate whole bag tasted couple thought barbecue flavor good decided go ahead order individual bags amazon barbecue sea salt vinegar br br definitely worth money want emphasize however fooled believing regular old fried chips taste texture something like cross rice cakes chips say rice cakes something puffed look rice cakes still good salt vinegar nice strong way like br br portion size pretty generous fellow weight watchers points per bag definitely make satisfying filling snack side sandwich br br would definitely recommend anyone sick limited flavors baked chips would like something comes wider variety exotic flavors planning trying parmesan garlic next,Positive

"Tazo's Focus tea is a blend of black tea, lemon balm, chicory, cocoa peels, roasted yerba mate, rose petals, citrus essence oil, rosemary and natural flavors. To me it mostly tastes like a mild lemony tea. It tastes pretty good with a few tablespoons of powdered milk (so it doesn't dilute the taste like milk would) and a packet of stevia. What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate. Since some articles online state that yerba mate causes cancer and others say it cures cancer it is probably best to do your own research before deciding if you want to drink this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",tazo focus tea blend black tea lemon balm chicory cocoa peels roasted yerba mate rose petals citrus essence oil rosemary natural flavors mostly tastes like mild lemony tea tastes pretty good tablespoons powdered milk dilute taste like milk would packet stevia noticed tea makes world shimmer aware beauty cup tea read negative positive things yerba mate think best drink tea occasionally drink instead normal tea coffee good want focus reading good book tea also make bit jittery caffeine also noticed good appetite suppressant drank hours dinner ate way less normal eating salad made much smaller dinner salad even skipped adding chicken tea also contains theobromine found chocolate since articles online state yerba mate causes cancer others say cures cancer probably best research deciding want drink tea br br rebecca review,Positive

"My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated...

When I took a Chinese cooking class from a lady whose family owns 5 restaurants and specializes in Chinese gourmet dishes (yes there are common recipes and then there are superior tasting recipes with slightly more exotic ingredients and fancier preparation).

Gourmet recipes call for thick and thin soy sauce.

"I will admit, my dog is spoiled. Not in a ""dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled."" Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat ""caps."" The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official ""Everlasting"" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it ""just right.""

"I've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.  I've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest.",making eating rice throughout entire life years done quite fancy ad hock rice dishes putting together anything like zojirushi cuckoo rice makers recently got interested making authentic spanish paellas br br first thing discovered ingredients expensive real spanish saffron spanish chorizo spanish paprika rare expensive items even los angeles california rabbit easy find either nevertheless went program decided build authentic paella watching plethora youtube videos pau gasol local tv two episodes tyler ultimate one episode good eats felt grasp essentials br br one thing spaniards stress fool around lot ingredients three things cannot compromise authentic pure saffron calisparra bomba valencia real smoky hot paprika spain good extra virgin olive oil also need use authentic high carbon steel paella quite inexpensive got fully legit one valencia import duty tag everything bucks also gathered use chicken thighs rabbit meat chicken stock fluid br br make long story short purchased pack expensive rice wondering going live praises heaped heavens upon chefs called rock n roll star rice world called rolls royce rice said unbeatable skeptical eaten lot rice life thousand pounds tried lot different types different one way another good br br according poop sheets bomba absolutely unique ability absorb x mass fluid yet never gets sticky sloppy hard overcook made lot rice lot varieties rice call ratio fluid rice never sources said use bomba bomba delicious absorbs fluids flavors measure measure form rice br br make long story short made first authentic spanish paella days ago blew brains say lightly bunch delicious rice dishes time beat like revelation god see many serious minded gourmet chefs like alton brown tyler florence guy fieri paula dean et al obsess getting dish done right pretty frickin stunning flavor explosion br br bomba delicious rice eaten lot rice one making forget rest,Positive

"Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature.  Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way.  Not so.

I still had one pack of 2 bars left, and heard a woman with a french accent ask the snack bar operator if he had any chocolate left.

"I love espresso in the evening, and good dark American coffee in a french press in the morning. I thought Starbucks was good until I tried Alterra, which is the best for whole beans. I tried about 30 kinds of K cups after buying the machine for something faster.  I learned that the extra bolds are the only ones with much flavor, that the ""espressos' are certainly not espresso, that some are too bitter and almost muddy, and I settled on the Green mountain Sumatran. It was not nearly as full flavored or as good as my french press using Alterra Brazilian bourbon coffee, but in a hurry it was much faster than grinding beans, boiling water, mixing it in the french press, and waiting 5 minutes to push down the plunger and drink the coffee. But recently when I tried to reorder, Amazon was out and I searched for a new K cup coffee. I was scientific, as I read all Amazon reviews on extra bold coffees that received almost unanimous 5 star ratings, ordering 4 of them to try: Tully's Sumatra, Van Houtte Taste of Europe 100% Colombian (I never knew Colombia was in Europe?), Caribou Mahogany, and Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights coffee. I have rated and tried them over and over and they always rank Parisian #1, Mahogany a not too distant #2, Sumatran #3, and Colombian (the lightest one) a distant #4. I then later tried Parisian against my old favorite Green mountain Sumatran, and clearly Parisian is the absoute best. It is still not as good as my french press coffee, but it has good deep flavor without bitterness and I do not feel deprived when I drink it in the morning.",love espresso evening good dark american coffee french press morning thought starbucks good tried alterra best whole beans tried kinds k cups buying machine something faster learned extra bolds ones much flavor espressos certainly espresso bitter almost muddy settled green mountain sumatran nearly full flavored good french press using alterra brazilian bourbon coffee hurry much faster grinding beans boiling water mixing french press waiting minutes push plunger drink coffee recently tried reorder amazon searched new k cup coffee scientific read amazon reviews extra bold coffees received almost unanimous star ratings ordering try tully sumatra van houtte taste europe colombian never knew colombia europe caribou mahogany timothy extra bold parisian nights coffee rated tried always rank parisian mahogany distant sumatran colombian lightest one distant later tried parisian old favorite green mountain sumatran clearly parisian absoute best still good french press coffee good deep flavor without bitterness feel deprived drink morning,Positive

"Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable.

"In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of ""good"" where you grimace and rasp ""H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!"", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing.

"I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk...drinking it this way makes me more aware of the subtle differences between tea brands and ""flavors.""<br /><br />Even with all the herbal teas available, Earl Grey will always be my favorite tea. The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey has just the right amount of bergamot. When I opened the individual foil-wrapped bag, the orange aroma hit me first...not overpowering, but rather inviting. This was a surprise because I've had some Earl Greys that had so much bergamot, I couldn't detect any other aromas.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth, and I've enjoyed every cup, but the real test was with my mother.

"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson.  After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam.  When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made.  This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam...""<br /><br />This stuff is great!  It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar.  It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on.  Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato.  This will be a regular item in my house.  I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.",skillet name popular seattle area food truck owned operated culinary institute america trained chef joshua henderson working variety top restaurants including stint head chef beverly hill avalon josh moved back seattle bought airstream trailer serves gourmet food seattle night time crowd br br skillet signature item simply called burger really sets apart deluxe hamburgers generous slathering henderson creation bacon jam first encountered product blown away heavenly bacon rich flavor rushed computer find made skillet website take big bunch really really good bacon render add bunch spices onions etc let simmer hours give quick puree blast chill bacon jam br br stuff great thick spreadable consistency hints powdered chilies brown sugar vinegar gives somewhat subtle unmistakable bacon taste whatever spread hamburgers natural used paninis grilled cheese sandwiches baked potato regular item house able use bacon jam things sandwiches look forward experimenting wonderful spread,Positive

"I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.

"These things grow like crazy.  I planted my gardens (one gourmet herbs, one holiday herbs) three months ago and I have trouble keeping up with the amount of growth.  I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.<br /><br />Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.<br /><br />I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant.

"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.

"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.

With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently.

"The first reason why I had even purchased this drink was because of a friend, of a friend, I saw their post on a blog telling people how this drink was ""so good and refreshing,"" that I, myself, wanted to give it a try. They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other ""energy"" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you.",first reason even purchased drink friend friend saw post blog telling people drink good refreshing wanted give try say never know something good till try br br amazon took awhile ship delivered day expect worked nicely packing drinks questionable bought things amazon real big deal star br br first took sip noticed difference many energy drinks lightly carbonated big understatement felt like juice would always cold way carbonated made feel way really consider energy drink stars tasted better expected bottles bit pricey big deal considering paying stop cruddy drinks br br last star period maybe weeks finished bottles gave younger siblings try none told anything described label happened loved taste opinion bliss best taste far tried sonic well recommend one maybe first days notice feeling calmer energy wise feel like energy things wanted around house school lot br br reason giving last star drink good better expected price per drink bad considering energy drinks cost range little extra get something better hidden see actually plus tastes great br br recently purchased neuro sun neuro sleep probably end writing reviews well br br neuro bliss opinion definitely worth money go buying drink expecting much way try end better could expected maybe even surprise,Positive

I was very well pleased. AND THE BOTTLES!! These were the most unusual glass soda bottles I have ever seen. The top plastic piece comes off and reveals a plastic break off tool to use to open the bottle which is sealed by a glass bead.

"I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same.

I have to say that all these health-related rules of thumbs are confusing, and you can find reports claiming directly opposite things, for example, isolated antioxidants (pills, basically) don't seem to do squat in humans (in petri dishes they do work). But when consumed as food they seem to work, and oregano is very rich in this stuff.

"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

My son, however, thinks it's darn near the best stuff in the world.<br /><br />After he had some at a friend's house and came home raving about it, I (reluctantly) bought a box for his use as an after-school snack. According to him, it's the kind of quick food that staves off after-school hunger so severe that it will actually kill a 12-year old boy if he doesn't counteract it by eating something the second he arrives home. (After all, dinner is still a couple hours away; FAR too long to save a hungry, growing boy from complete starvation.)<br /><br />At his request, I bought him a box of Cheeseburger Mac Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles at our local grocery store.

I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said ""It's fondant!""  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said ""It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!"".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.

"I ended up choosing this from the numerous mint tea options available on amazon because I'd tried Revolution's Earl Grey before and loved it. This stuff is just fantastic! First of all, it comes in a tetrahedral teabag, as opposed to a flat one. The bag is made out of a sort of nylon-type mesh instead of paper, so you don't get any weird paper taste (it matters more in the more delicate herbal teas than the darker black teas, for me anyway). Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar.

"I recently tried this soda when I was in NYC in June.  My girlfriend, I and my best friend went to the Carnegie deli for lunch.

I ordered the Woody Allen which was pastrami and corned beef on rye with cel-ray soda.  The sandwich was huge, only ate half.

"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time.

"I found this in my pantry while looking for the Fruit 'n Cream Quaker Instant Oatmeal we usually eat (I like the peaches and cream flavor), and I gave it a shot.  It was so good!  The instructions made it so easy... Basically, the  oatmeal comes in an oblong pouch (paper-feel), you rip it open, dump it into a bowl, fill the pouch with water, pour it over the oatmeal, pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  And tada, hot and delicious breakfast!<br /><br />I usually have a large breakfast, so I use two pouches at once--double oatmeal, double water, put it in the microwave for 3:30 minutes.  I mix in a teaspoon of honey, and it's just right for me with a mug of hot tea.  I've been sick the past few days, and most food has not sat well with me, but this oatmeal has been very easy on the tummy.  Also, it's whole-grain and has flax seeds in it, which adds more fiber to your diet and helps digestion.<br /><br />My only mystery was where it came from.  I assumed it must have been from the local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry it when I asked.  It turns out it was from Target, and my MIL put it in a care package she sent us!

Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.

"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.

We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.

"I have a 3 1/2 year old American Bulldog that has gone through thousands of dollars in vet bills and worthless speculations. She has been on Grandma Lucy's Rabbit Pureformance for several days now and I have already noticed the vast improvement in her demeanor and energy level. My dog used to violently scratch at herself till she made herself bleed. We discovered that she was allergic to beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and duck. Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself.

"These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times ""healthy"" or ""good for you"" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.

"I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only.

Two weeks of the combo up there on a guided camping trip and I was hooked enough to buy some online here in the States when I returned.

Perhaps it is like a mocha (have never tried one), but so easy and SOOOOO GOOD.  I believe a 14.1 ounce container will last two months for 1 person using it as I did and once a day.

"I bought this on a whim at my natural foods store, but I will be purchasing it here in the future because it is much cheaper online.  I have read all over the internet that this is a great beauty product, and really wonderful for your hair.  I started doing weekly vinegar scalp treatments (50/50 ratio with water) a few weeks ago, and I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that I'm shedding.  I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.  I am also so thankful that it is nontoxic and it doesn't have a bunch of harmful chemicals in it.

"I am very leery of ""energy drinks."" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this.

"There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.

As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.<br /><br />It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.<br /><br />I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.  Also, the bags and string are some sort of plastic-like material, so I cannot put them in my compost bin.<br /><br />As an iced tea, I liked the Blackberry Vanilla.

"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available.

For coffee and tea is is not even half as creamy as Silk so it falls short there.  I had figured it would be a thinner product but since Amazon's nutritional data stated 80 calories per cup, as opposed to 100 per cup of Silk, I figured I could use a bit more rice milk to make up for it's more watery consistency.

So it's a good product and I like the taste although I prefer the less sweet original version of Silk.

"While no worse than your average bowl of Raisin Bran, I was disappointed that I didn't find this to be noticeably better. The flavor of cinnamon could certainly be stronger (for my tastes, anyway), and the little slivers of almonds didn't really add to the ""crunch"" in any sort of meaningful way. And unlike the experience of some other reviewers, I found that this Raisin Bran got soggy remarkably fast after the milk was added, turning to slurry by the last few bites. I've definitely had other Raisin and Bran products that remained crisp longer.<br /><br />I was also a bit taken aback by the box, which holds only 14.5 ounces of cereal. It's the same height and width as the regular cereal box you'd see on the store shelf, but to hide the fact that you're not getting much cereal, the box is so skinny that I actually had trouble getting it to stand on end a time or two. And maybe this is common to a lot of cereals these days - it was just new to me.<br /><br />Overall, I've got nothing bad to say about this product...but to give it a rating of more than 3 stars, I'd have to feel like it was ""better than average"" somehow.

"We installed our pet door about 2 weeks ago and so far it works great! Our two dogs are taking awhile to get used to it. At first they were scared of it, now they both use it but one of the dogs doesn't realize yet that I don't have to be right there for him to go out. I'm sure he will figure it out as time goes on.<br /><br />My only advice would be to not necessarily follow the instructions on what height to put the door at (it says to put the bottom of the door an inch lower than your dog's chest height). We followed the directions on the height to install it at, and our 40 and 50 lb dogs practically have to leap out the door rather than calmly walking out.

"My first impression is that this product is just another way to sell artificial sweetener. I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.",first impression product another way sell artificial sweetener tried flavors overwhelming characteristic sweetness may like main drawback though flavoring complex mean narrow range flavor receptors working tongue drink cast mixture sweetness single flavor seems complex clearly taste things sweetness specific flavor br br enjoy drinking something refreshing interesting example add freshly squeezed lemon sugar water whole mouth seems pick range flavors sensations leaves slight satisfying aftertaste mio hand hits tongue strong blast sweetness flavor disappears leaves aftertaste lingering back tongue vague yet strangely familiar taste artificial sweeteners seem br br better ways flavor water afraid,Positive

The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.

A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).

"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.

"My job has me running around on my feet for 8 hours a day so it's important that I stay hydrated.  Lately I have been drinking whatever I bring from home (usually something similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026I0O14"">Propel Fitness Water</a>) or just water from the dispenser.  The thing I've noticed with the sports drinks are that they actually leave me thirstier and water usually leaves me full once I'm able to drink enough to quench my thirst.<br /><br />I did read some of the reviews before deciding to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0"">Essentia 9.5 pH</a> and based on them being mostly positive I wanted to give it a try. The bottle I received lasted me the entire day at work and I didn't have to go searching for more which was nice. The taste was much better than tap and even better than the bottled dispenser water we have.  As for the claims of ""helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more"" I can't really prove or disprove them after just one bottle. The only thing I can say is that I did feel like it quenched my thirst better than anything I've been drinking. Is it all in my imagination?

"First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!",first foremost enjoyed blonde variety starbucks since conception pointless tell buy product religiously think best coffee market today tell packaging count package experience k cups general br br opt go higher count package please note come retail box packaging sure k cups get brown box versus several retail packages big deal least large box rather recycle one box several smaller ones point issue buy different quantity secondly k cup patent great one unfortunately keurig days numbered tried grind beans use ecobrew reusable k cup filter get results veranda blend k cup unsuccessful getting want continued pay higher price per cup coffee end still think worth unique blend assure prices per cup likely fall upon expiration k cup patent keep wallet handy hopefully fall price due competition near future br br service amazon usual prime,Positive

"I purchased the Made in Nature ""Club Pack"" size because the price was good and the description seemed identical to the Made in Nature product sold as a 12-pack of 6 oz. bags.  The latter product had the following listed for the Nutrition Facts link:  ""Unsulfured, Sun-dried, Certified Organic Seedless Raisins.""  In other words, no additives are listed.  I thought that the Club Pack size would be the same, even though the Amazon description did not include a Nutrition Facts link.  Well, I just got my order today and the packages listed ""organic sunflower oil"" as an additive.  Also, it is disconcerting that the package does not specifically state that the raisins are unsulfured.  I will not be purchasing these raisins again.<br /><br />Update:  I increased my rating after checking further and finding out that the raisins are unsulfured.  Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%.  Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page.  Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins.  Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats).  The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added.  The package label on the website still shows the additive.  However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Made In Nature.<br />We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Amazon and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products.

"I've always heard that Stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no ill side effects, so I was very interested to try it... especially when I started making my own yogurt, and would do anything to get my toddler to eat it! I did some research and found that the SweetLeaf brand was supposed to be the best, as far as extraction methods and experience. I got a bottle of the Vanilla Creme, and also the plain, and added it to our yogurt. It was fantastic! We all loved it, and the toddler begged for more. I was so relieved to have found a great way to reduce the sugar in our diets and still have such a great sweet taste. It was perfect, I was happy. But then, strange symptoms started to surface. At first I got headaches, which became increasingly severe, and then backaches that felt like spinal 'brain freeze' (when you eat something too cold too fast.) It didn't occur to me at first that it could be at all related to the new Stevia. Then my toddler started telling me he was itchy all over. Then I got my menstrual cycle 2 weeks early. Finally it dawned on me that it could be related to the Stevia since this was the only thing at all that had changed in our diets. I googled 'adverse reactions to Stevia' and found several webpages where people described symptoms identical to mine. I was truly shocked. I stopped the Stevia... all the symptoms went away almost immediately. I realize now that there is a difference between the flavored liquid Stevia, which contains a 'proprietary blend' and 'natural flavors' (which could mean anything) and just the straight powder with nothing added (I haven't tried that, but won't now.) It also occurs to me that maybe the only Stevia that can truly be considered historically safe is the actual leaf itself, straight off the plant out of the garden. I still believe Stevia's safety record in the countries where it originated, but I think something has probably been lost in translation with the processing of it here in the US. Just my opinion. It should also be noted that anyone with allergies to ragweed should not take Stevia because it can cause asthma attacks.

"I spent HOURS researching dog food.  I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.<br />Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that ""dog smell"".  It has to be the food. :)",spent hours researching dog food wolf pup taste wild wellness core wc last choice researched dogs allergic chicken asked vet said true say common said go chicken save lamb bison alternatives would become allergic wc became choice grain free liked picked food picked new puppy started half half dog food breeder giving research almost cried poured brand knowing bad fillers corn garbage stuff went two days mixing went straight wcore great half weeks point never digestion problems never loose stools hoping miracle food everyone claiming produce much better fur low dander bathed times one week know bit compulsive skin problems little lbs moved cup day eat less typical dog food brand recommending almost cups wc right track eating cup day divided thirds fourths throughout day feel little better spending extra money knowing lasting longer typical bag brand dog food love ingredients healthy hangup comment read dog like spending sixty dollars find like called customer service explained would money back guarantee sealed deal lab mix loves looked back br update weeks old needing bath week longer dog smell food,Positive

"My baby girl absolutely adores Sprout stage 1 and 2 pureed baby foods, so I was really looking forward to giving her Sprout stage 3 foods when she turned 8 months old and was ready for an introduction to textured solids.  The first time we tried this Sprout stage 3 Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese, my little-one gagged so hard that her eyes watered!  (And she also panicked a little ... very scary for Mom & Dad!)  I know that a bit of gagging is to be expected when introducing a baby to textured solids, but this was well beyond the norm.  I then tried some of the Mac & Cheese myself, and while it was certainly flavorful, it contained pretty large chunks of food, like whole pieces of elbow macaroni.  Plus, it was so thick that you could barely stir it with a spoon.  Definitely too much for my baby, who'd only had smooth purees up to that point.  Sprout is definitely the thickest and chunkiest of the organic stage 3 baby foods that I've tried.  The stage 3 training dinners from Plum Organics and Ella's Kitchen are textured, but they contain very small, soft bits of meat, vegetables and rice/pasta that were much easier for my baby to manage (i.e., little or no gagging).<br /><br />Once your baby is comfortable eating chunky textured solids, Sprout stage 3 baby foods are bound to become a favorite.  The Mac & Cheese (and the other flavors) are very tasty and well-seasoned, minus the added salt and sugar, which babies don't need.  And Sprout baby food is certified organic to boot.  Therefore, I'll be storing these stage 3 pouches in the back of my pantry for a few weeks until my baby girl is ready for them.<br /><br />For advanced textured solid-eaters: A<br />For newbies: C",baby girl absolutely adores sprout stage pureed baby foods really looking forward giving sprout stage foods turned months old ready introduction textured solids first time tried sprout stage butternut squash mac cheese little one gagged hard eyes watered also panicked little scary mom dad know bit gagging expected introducing baby textured solids well beyond norm tried mac cheese certainly flavorful contained pretty large chunks food like whole pieces elbow macaroni plus thick could barely stir spoon definitely much baby smooth purees point sprout definitely thickest chunkiest organic stage baby foods tried stage training dinners plum organics ella kitchen textured contain small soft bits meat vegetables rice pasta much easier baby manage e little gagging br br baby comfortable eating chunky textured solids sprout stage baby foods bound become favorite mac cheese flavors tasty well seasoned minus added salt sugar babies need sprout baby food certified organic boot therefore storing stage pouches back pantry weeks baby girl ready br br advanced textured solid eaters br newbies c,Positive

"For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little ""bumps"" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.

"Of course no bagged tea can ever be the ""best tea ever"", but in the realm of bagged, this tea is about the best you could ever ask for.<br /><br />Twinings Everyday is just that- a tea that's perfect every day of the week. It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong brews. My father-in-law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong brew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.<br /><br />The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar.

"There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.

It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood.

She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad.

"We have had our youngest Pug on Earthborn since we got him (10 weeks.) We recently switched him to this to get him off the puppy food (which we recommend as well). We've always been very happy with Earthborn products. Our Pugs coats are so soft and I know it's because of this food. Our older Pug before was on a different brand and we recently put him on this now too and his coat transformed! :) The only reason I give this food 4 stars is because it gives our dogs HORRIBLE gas. Pugs are gaseous anyways, but this makes it sometimes seems lethal.

"I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.",tried options amazon com jack link turkey jerky turkey nuggets snackmasters range brown turkey jerky golden valley natural turkey jerky among others various retail outlets totally different brands turkey jerky beef variety among turkey oberto favorite far br br given jerky made dehydration process dryness inherent jerky food also turkey dryer meat beef common jerky found turkey jerky average dryer beef jerky prefer jerky relatively moist br br oberto turkey jerky far moist jerky aside oberto pork brand package usually large strips hold water content greater lengths time brands tried broken small pieces chewy dry comparison another key aspect flavoring product well flavored whereas products often taste like proteinated cardboard teriyaki flavor oberto overdo salt either entire product natural less processed br br overview br pros moist tastey natural minimally processed br cons oberto turkey comes teriyaki br br bottom line want turkey jerky mind teriyaki probably best easily obtainable product,Positive

"I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant.

"Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as ""mild"" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Amazon had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail.",currently k cup pack listed mild amazon expecting something little flavor bitterness k cups surprised strong bold extra bold flavors difference reasonably subtle certainly bland tasteless also taste little sweet smoky described br br note packaging bought coffee people pack amazon k cups came one box thick corrugated cardboard coffee people box amazon stuck mailing labels box gave usps coffee arrived k cups thin timothy cardboard box amazon put inside one standard corrugated cardboard boxes upshot timothy packs mailed double boxed unlike coffee people packs seems less likely timothy packs get damaged mail,Positive

"Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.",searching high low salt change life end journey murray river sea salt br br first stumbled salt local outlet cultlike nationwide chain store pretends sell highest quality foods also happily lends imprimatur made china foods sometimes turn tainted ignoring controversies associated store one day package salt sold store stirred interest led salt completing last step long probably ecologically unsound trip australia kitchen br br thing murray river salt pinkish flakes fragile crumble easily fingers also seems dissolve almost immediately contact food sharp contrast every salt tried currently kinds coarse crystal salt house none crushed fingers remain large hard chunks salt yes represent flavors murray river salt something gentle friendly salt totally unsubstantiated theory salt better body hardened crystals salts br br household keeps murray river salt salt cellar case small lidded wooden bowl pinched fingers instead using traditional tiny spoon crumbled directly onto food plate sanitary reasons small amount salt time put bowl way bowl gets cleaned frequently frequent cleaning seems like necessity fingers even washed ones tools choice dispensing salt words wise invite nose pickers table provide salt shaker hide murray river stuff till left small children home wait grown draining bank account safe distance far college purchasing placing salt table br br another reviewer mentioned use finishing salt household concurs rarely ever add salt anything cooking process keep kosher salt couple sea salts larger salt use cooking needs like baking frankly seems like time one add much salt cooking process good stuff table food serve br br chain store mentioned longer carries salt amazon logical alternative br br note purchased lb bag keeps well live desert next time probably purchase multi pack smallest bags small amount per unit weight exchange convenience smaller packages,Positive

"Baby Gourmet promises to bring organic goodness to baby food without added sugar, salt, dairy,eggs or nuts.  Additionally it is free of fillers, thickeners and gluten.

"I loved the idea of popcorn that would pop in its own bowl. I gave it a try tonight as I settled in to watch a movie. The first thing I noticed as it popped was that the sides of the bag were a red see through type of material so you could see the popcorn popping. Not sure if that's needed but I liked it so it was a plus. The ""bowl"" was disappointing though. Essentially, its just a bag of popcorn that you place on it's side, rip the side off & you eat the popcorn this way so you have a wide opening to eat from. Problem is, where you tear the side off doesn't work well. I followed the directions and found the area that is supposed to rip off didn't go smoothly & part of it didn't tear where it should & I ended up having to go back & rip more areas off, etc. Perhaps with practice you can get it right but it was a little underwhelming. The popcorn was a little bland also. Great idea but poor design.

"What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting.

"I've heard how stinky tripe can be, but these tripe treats have about the same ""stinkiness"" level as the dried beef lung that I've given to my little sheltie.  Not too bad.  Just in case, I do give these treats to my 30 lb sheltie on her ""meal blanket"" to keep any tripe bits or tripe-scented drool off the carpet, because my dog would lick the carpet for days.  (When I gave these to her on our wood deck, she licked the deck for a few minutes afterward until I pulled her away.... ow, tongue splinters!)<br /><br />So, Zoey gives these treats two paws up.  It takes her about 2 or 3 minutes to eat an entire treat (she chews her food thoroughly, she's not a gulper).  I give her one treat a day, and it hasn't adversely affected her stools at all.  Her tummy accepted it into her diet quite readily.<br /><br />There were 15 treats in my 5 oz bag, each 5-6"" long.

"""Ingredients you can see & prounounce...""  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE"">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46"">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.",ingredients see prounounce okay exactly amaranth quinoa ridden camel state fair even penetrated japanese prime ministerial security say know stuff br br product page appears clusters supposed little bite size globs vanilla blueberry goodness unfortunately mine arrived amazon com book mailer two little cluster like bits rest smashed separated bird seed figure clusters stuff would pretty good make lot easier eat stuff go package copy boldly exhorts br br credit package opened right away first pull right along top edge surprised many packages get right like tortillas beef jerky lunch meat advantage already br br first came sniff test stuff smell general kind industrial neutral cloying smell artificial blueberry relieved smell distinct powerful scent nothing grain seed salty spicy sugary sweet far ingredients step package copy seemed hint factory chemicals purposes crunch freshness whatever saying product seemed discern smell br br tried third package go mode right package good stuff would great product bring along hike campout bag small size would make awfully hard share couple people taste great clear natural sweetness crunchy unpleasant brittle crunchiness get foods br br tried third package little bit milk good stayed crunchy good long time way eating density caused product sink bottom bottom feed spoon get br br put remaining third milk sprinkled href http www amazon com gp product b kowjqe equal top yeah considerably sweeter maybe even little much recommendation sweeten product real sugar would make stuff way sweet br br taste taste keeping smell grainy taste blueberries subtle vanilla could taste subdued overall taste quite good good texture br br nutrition man getting lot fiber lot product package front makes clear like saturated fat trans fats cholesterol etc pretty good also getting lot calcium iron vitamin c package front says refined sugars product listed ingredients include official stand ins euphemisms sugar like evaporated cane juice product serving size miniscule cup comes calories single package ate dinner comes close calories great energy food great saturday morning cereal bender front cartoon network br br price unit price comes bag something like dollar big box cereal truth told big boxes come oz product comes oz get considerably product money regular boxed cereal br br bottom line good product enjoyed taste texture good like href http www amazon com gp product b ea kashi cereals bit concentrated bit spendy,Positive
"I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this ""tea"" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be ""sweetened with honey"" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to ""honey granules"".  Because of this, it has a very strong ""diet"" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.

"I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat. She was scratching her skin off and licking constantly. The vet prescribed everything under the sun, antibiotics, special shampoos, special dog food, including a certain amount of sunlight daily.

Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now.

"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",received hill science diet ideal balance dog food try bzzagent feeding terrier tends show results changes diet quicker corgi belgian sheepdog dog mom years including participating dog sports sled dog running agility dog shows proper nutrition vital dogs health ability participate things love currently activities dogs still picky eat br br received bzzkit lb bag hill science diet ideal balance dog food checked ingredients first listed chicken good followed brown rice whole grain wheat good meat ingredient better corn next cracked pearl barley soybean meal chicken meal admit paused soybean meal experience soy positive addition dog food find foods contain result looser stools greater volume dog overall condition high one fed food without soy inexpensive ingredient associated filler dog community curious see terrier would handle fare food stars one meat ingredient first ingredients inclusion soy br br rex terrier became immediately interested opened bag anxious see smell must enticing picky eater anticipated like ideal balance anticipate eager get slowly course days switched ideal balance previous food reduce stomach upset diet change found ate ideal balance nuggets first cleaning bowl may new novel may liked better dog tell seems like much even use ideal balance training treat stars taste br br rex eating ideal balance couple weeks long enough complete picture impact condition long enough get idea going br br coat nice nice seen change coat condition ideal balance diet least maintaining coat good condition need time see food long term impact rex coat stars coat maintenance br br rex tendency gain weight really watch much eats ideal balance helps pack means feed less means buying less food long run really watch weight means getting lot food crude protein crude fat protein high fat content maybe little higher seek might choose weight control version ideal balance becomes regular diet one exists stars body weight maintenance br br dirty part review stools dog stool tell lot tolerating diet rex stools ideal balance firm maybe little larger previous food smell objectionable normal tells digesting food normally well close optimally could little smaller much looking change necessarily noticed stars stool quality br br overall give hill science diet ideal balance dog food stars nd meat source soy present could good faith give stars based rex condition diet try sure monitor dog weight adjust much feed accordingly,Positive

I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.,love cereal bars mixed nuts protein bars favorite right amount crunch gm protein definitely heavy calories fat keep full much longer regular cereal bar best part like bars extra sugary right amount sugar remove blandness nuts love,Positive
"These are perfect for the peanut fan in your life - basically what you have is a ton of peanuts held together by peanut butter.  Now true they threw in a bit of granola and some fake honey like stuff to kick it up a notch - but 95% of what is in this bar is either peanuts or something made from peanuts.  Needless to say that the fat content is pretty high, but you DO get some protein in the mix.<br /><br />I don't know of many people who could eat more then one of these - maybe my youngest - but most people will need a full beverage because much like bar peanuts, these Big Nut bars are salty.  The good news is that they are filling.  So if you are stuck in a long meeting at work and your stomach rumbles while the lunch hour looks to be sneaking farther and farther away - one of these should do the trick.<br /><br />Though they probably won't be a regular buy in our household (I mean, where's the chocolate REALLY?) they are most likely something that we will pick up now and again for road trips or to keep an extra one in the desk drawer at work.<br /><br />***Adding to the review - apparently not ALL of the bars are salty - the first one I ate was.  A few days later on a road trip I had another one and it was far sweeter then the first.  Perhaps the batch my box came from wasn't fully mixed - either way they were good sweet or salty***",perfect peanut fan life basically ton peanuts held together peanut butter true threw bit granola fake honey like stuff kick notch bar either peanuts something made peanuts needless say fat content pretty high get protein mix br br know many people could eat one maybe youngest people need full beverage much like bar peanuts big nut bars salty good news filling stuck long meeting work stomach rumbles lunch hour looks sneaking farther farther away one trick br br though probably regular buy household mean chocolate really likely something pick road trips keep extra one desk drawer work br br adding review apparently bars salty first one ate days later road trip another one far sweeter first perhaps batch box came fully mixed either way good sweet salty,Positive

"This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.",review regular sliced pepperoni way use nuke microwave couple minutes makes nice spicy pepperoni chip low carb diet kind reminds thin slices spicy bacon anyway done lots different kinds pepperoni pepperoni astonishes quantity fat thrown cooking grease soaks several layers paper towel people talked eating raw would lot fat pepperoni tried generated quantity fat cooking br br crisped gotten rid fat crispy quite nice slices thin go long burn flash going try thick sliced see work br br update tried thick sliced perfect application pepperoni chips way better thin sliced still amazed much orange grease comes things microwaving done cooking great consistency nice amount kick kind like spicy bacon imagine thick would good pizza mind oil added pie,Positive

"I ordered a 12-pack of the Lindt 85% cacao chocolate bars from Amazon in January... They are my favorite variety.... the 90% is too bitter for me, while the 70% has too much sugar.

And supposedly good for you health too, if taken in moderation.<br /><br />But despite some of the comments above, the box I received had the same (good) formulation for the 85% bars that I've seen in the past -- 5g of protein and 5g of sugar per serving size (four squares), along with 15g of carbohydrates (5%).<br /><br />I find I'm really satisfied by eating just two squares after lunch...

This bar is not a delivry of carb's, sugar, fat etc.. it's focus is protein and it does a very good job at it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this bar if you object to the poor sawdust taste of most protein bars (Cliff Builder, Myoplex, Think, Powerbar, etc...) I also find that most protein bars start off OK, then then when the tastebuds start to find the underlying protein and lack of sweetness it becomes teidious to finish... not the Stinger!

This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.<br /><br />Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.<br /><br />One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.<br /><br />On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter.",mind qualify cookie food needs possess two ingredients sugar fat reduce eliminate either longer cookie sad imitation one generally worth eating quaker tried make better cookie reducing evil components adding virtuous ones case whole grain oats yields cookie whole grain fiber offset least partially less nutritious aspects br br let look numbers two classic cookies three nabisco oreos weigh grams calories grams fat gram fiber three chips ahoy chocolate chip cookies weigh grams calories grams fat gram fiber br br one quakers weighs grams calories grams fat grams fiber get cookie calories fat get times fiber good two hands winner unfortunately reality intrudes br br hand bad perhaps step behind nabiscos keeblers love like reached stage life need sure get enough fiber every day represent painless way get sixth needed feel like eaten cookie styrofoam imposter,Positive

I was hoping this sauce would be as good as the Chuy's one. It is better. The sauce has surprising depth; it is fresh tasting, and well balanced. Not too spicy at all, but the spice mixture definitely comes though, garlic, onion, bell peppers. It is very easy for packaged sauces to lose their spices with the preseratives and packing. The jalpeno sauce does not. It has a lot of uses for me. You can use it as a full flavored salad dressing. As a diping sauce. You can add it to other sauces.

"After using an ""all-natural"" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.",using natural gum contained cane sugar getting first cavity years months use knew needed switch heard xylitol naturopathic student basically bad bacteria mouth feed xylitol digest good bacteria eat proliferate thought tried xylitol gums past like decided give another chance want gum chew meals actually good teeth pleasantly surprised spry gum great flavor goes away pretty soon chewing nice shot good taste best part gum great texture continues fun chew long want even turn hard drinking water like gums medical student search research literature claims xylitol proven however literature research studies explain need g xylitol day need get average piece gum g need chew least pieces day get dental benefits chewing sporadically e day show dental benefits problem chew one every meal day love fresh clean feeling well knowing something great teeth,Positive

The nuts and raisens make this a high Potassium candy bar actually good for you. Really no kidding. I discovered this in 94 when I was diagnosed with low K+...to the extremes. I was in this super crave anything with K+ from Bananas which everyone knows and avacodo's to these little morsels. At the time they had come out in a trick or treat snack size or about 1/4 the size of this candy bar today. I was scarfing them. I hadn't been diagnosed yet. Once that happened my own instincts and natural cravings made more sense...I was looking at the ingredients to this candy bar at the time because I'd had sucn intense cravings for the Chunky and back then they actually listed the K+ levels....per full size bar at over 300 mg. That certainly explained it. Since I've never denied my cravings for it though my K levels are back to normal. Today they no longer list K levels.....but why not Chunky? You should reconsider....nothing wrong with promotion of some good stuff along with this product. K+ is good for people after excercise and hard work. Of course it's the raisens and peanuts that are the big contributors. This isn't over the top but who wouldn't rather take a nibble of a yummy candy bar that's good for you instead of a vitamen pill that's questionable and lacks the raisens and nuts.

"This sounded like a great idea, especially for people who like expensive vitamin water that comes pre-bottled. This is a greener way to get the same flavor and vitamin benefit with a reusable bottle. This would be great, except I didn't like it all that much. It was just okay.<br /><br />It was hard to measure ""a squeeze"". The bottle has markings, but since it's gray, you can't see how much you've used. Plus, every time you squeeze, it's a little different. The first cup I tried, I squeezed some in without measuring. It seemed a little weak. Then, I measured 8 oz. water and 1 tablespoon (the .5 oz serving listed on the bottle) of the Energy drink. This produced a stronger tasting and much sweeter tasting outcome.

"I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see ""without gluten"" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say ""gluten free oats"" but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through ""subscribe and save"" ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!",eat gluten important product non gluten looked package nowhere see without gluten except ingredients lists whole grains used make product say gluten free oats still wondered grains another ingredient amaranth gluten neither oats easily become contaminated gluten processing checked site lo behold says non gluten package unless missing yes site br br took bag granola daughter husband house tried nice tasting cereal loaded whole grains experience reviewers said clusters bag words got kind granola dust mine big chunks like supposed mine packed box air pocket things came fine also notice funny aftertaste cost oz bags subscribe save per bag think little higher local walmart bear naked granola much higher also bear naked granola gluten free oats gluten free knowledge whereas kind variety br br although variety cereal cinnamon oat clusters flax seeds glycerin ingredient noticed bag bear naked fruit nut granola glycerin apparently raisins cranberries admit always associated glycerin soap like neutrogena note nitroglycerin explosive glycerin glycerin also apparently sweetener probably use raisins cranberries br br end would say like taste granola price one bad taste matter um taste non gluten may buy instead bear naked granola usually buy yes know walmart bear naked granola non gluten like cheap reasons understand absolutely abstain gluten although usually would definitely give granola chance like flavor go,Positive

"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand.

I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed.

"We had ordered the quart size root beer by Paragon (motla) and everyone at my daughter's birthday party (adults and children) loved it and came back for seconds.

To me, it tasted more like black licorice with a very strong aftertaste. I called Paragon and they said they cannot do anything about it, since we ordered it through Amazon. We cannot return it here because it is opened.

"**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.

"I purchased the Aerogarden system and a few kits last year.  On Jan 1st 2009 I took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the Salsa Garden kit.  This particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  I will mention each in detail here to help others.  The herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  Salsa Garden and other kits like this - i.e. Chili Pepper, Cherry Tomato, Snow Peas, Green Beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  These steps are the main changes for Salsa kit vs Herb kit.<br /><br />1. Plant Selection -  With the Salsa Garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  After several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  There will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  There will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  There will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  Plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. Pruning - This kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  Read that section carefully before your first pruning.  Then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  Eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  You will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. Growth Stabilization - This kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  After your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  Each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the Aerogarden.  I personally used 3 nylon strings that I removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  You can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  Some other sets like Green Bean kits have their own support devices, but for the Salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. Pollinating - This might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  As each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  As per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  Read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  I tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  After several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  Eventually I tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  My advice - use a feather.  This isn't the most practical method, but it works.  When you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  Do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  The pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  You may have trouble finding a feather - which I recommend using a very clean one at that.  DO NOT grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  You sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  Try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />My final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  The peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  Overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually I ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  If I hadn't, they'd be still going.  I got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but I only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  This was fun, but may not be for everyone.  If you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  On the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the Salsa Kit.",purchased aerogarden system kits last year jan st took remnants herb kit planted salsa garden kit particular kit several extra steps plant selection pruning growth stabilization pollinating mention detail help others herb gardens easiest cut need go mastered might find wanting try something else salsa garden kits like e chili pepper cherry tomato snow peas green beans etc require steps steps main changes salsa kit vs herb kit br br plant selection salsa garden must first make selection plants several days growth see small sprouts likely one sprout pod must cut back one plant per pod pods total kit pepper tomato spacers fill pod slots allow growth plants plant selection important make sure let extra sprouts keep growing eventually overrun pod space br br pruning kit instruction uses th branch system read section carefully first pruning afterwards continue prune throughout life plant prevent growth close lightbulbs trim wandering branches unable reach light eventually branches die cut afterwards accidently forget prune earlier continually get dead leaves especially near base plant fret happen lot outer edge plant gets light br br growth stabilization kit eventually require string twine etc plant grows big enough weight plant eventually cause begin leaning especially fruit vegetables begin appear plant need string stabilize light post back aerogarden personally used nylon strings removed shopping mall bag handle similar athletic short draw string also get twine thick strings like yarn almost hardware store crafts store supermarket sets like green bean kits support devices salsa kit must provide prepared br br pollinating might easiest step possibly plant begins flower pollination bees insects likely per instructions must gently shake plants cause pollen move eventually end one flowers read section carefully vigorously shake plants oppinion much tried step worked fine tomatoes peppers several waves blooms appeared mini jalapeno plant still amount shaking worked eventually tried shake little harder work also caused many leaves fall advice use feather practical method works see several blooms open lightly brush interior first flower second third etc forget come back brush first flower end cycle pollen stick feather stick back onto different flower similar hairs insect legs body may trouble finding feather recommend using clean one grab feather yard came wild bird farm animal sure want lice problems house try crafts store pull feather cheap household duster br br final opinion tomatoes grow easily without much trouble except stabilization peppers hand stabilize well enough keep fairly self pruned base pollinating bad boys little bit trick first overall fun kit produced way end eventually ran nutrients decided remove plants still going got months produce time lot got tomatoes time pepper time lots weeks fun may everyone mastered herb kit would interesting next step hand trouble herb kit might want pass salsa kit,Positive

"Domata Living Flour put the joy back in my gluten-free cooking.  I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen.",domata living flour put joy back gluten free cooking introduced four years ago local celiac support group cup cup replacement purpose flour favorite recipes even use make roux recipes find best add tad flour tad liquid tell whether need either mixing ingredients recipes need increase baking time gluten free flours tend take longer bake use cakes cookies muffins bread breading fried foods pie crusts pastries gravies roux waffles whatever noticed foods fried domata living flour absorb much oil foods fried purpose wheat flour crisper reheat well without turning soggy need extra gluten pie crusts add tad xanthan gum find quite stretchy enough pastry recipes taste texture equal purpose wheat flour baked goods may rise quite much wheat flour find cakes muffins still size made purpose wheat flour shared many celiacs cook celiacs hit every one one note using old bread recipe remember gluten free dough gluten developed kneading benefit second rise recipes include either without harm advantage br one gluten free flour must kitchen,Positive

"What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it.

"The BBQ sauce was delivered as promised. I tried it out on a nice steak. It has a nice flavor, but it is not at all hot. I would rate it mild to medium at best. The flavor makes up for the lack of a kick. I have used it now on chicken and salmon with great results. I also tried mixing it in with a wild rice blend and that was delicious! If you only care about spicyness this may not be the sauce for you, but if great flavor is your thing...this sauce is a winner!",bbq sauce delivered promised tried nice steak nice flavor hot would rate mild medium best flavor makes lack kick used chicken salmon great results also tried mixing wild rice blend delicious care spicyness may sauce great flavor thing sauce winner,Positive
"We love the Durkee Texas Red Chili mix and have placed orders for it on Amazon since we've be unable to find it in-store locally.  I buy it by the box and store it before we need it.  When opening this shipment, we did not receive the Texas Red Chili Mix as ordered, but the original mix.  Frustrating, because it's been 30 days and I can't return it now for an exchange.  I'm going to put a new order in, but definitely will check the box for content when it arrives this time!",love durkee texas red chili mix placed orders amazon since unable find store locally buy box store need opening shipment receive texas red chili mix ordered original mix frustrating days return exchange going put new order definitely check box content arrives time,Positive
